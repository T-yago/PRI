During a particularly bad stage, my dermatologist prescribed Seysara and noted that it was the first new treatment he had been able to offer Acne patients in many years.  After 3 weeks, my Acne was much better.  After 6 weeks, I have no breakouts at all and am remaining clear day after day.  The only drug that worked as quickly for me was Ceftin, another antibiotic with much harsher side effects.  Seysara side effects are minimal.  I did notice an increase in mild headaches at first, but they subsided.  I would recommend trying this drug for Acne.  \"]",

    "medical_condition_description":"Acne Other names: Acne Vulgaris; Blackheads; Breakouts; Cystic Acne; Pimples; Whiteheads; Zits Acne is a skin condition caused by dead skin cells sticking together and clogging up pores. Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of Acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop Acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have Acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from Acne worse than others. Bad Acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get Acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of Acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skin’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your Acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of Acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your Acne. It is a myth that you have to let Acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the Acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-Acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe Acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using Acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your Acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote Acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin. See a dermatologist if you feel shy or products don't work.",

If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from Acne worse than others. Bad Acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get Acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of Acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skin’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your Acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of Acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your Acne. It is a myth that you have to let Acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the Acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-Acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe Acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using Acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your Acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote Acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin.

The iPledge program was HORRIBLE and useless. I am not sexually active but yet had to be tortured by them. I give this medicine an A++++ but I give the dumb iPledge program an F------- times infinity. Horrible idea. Lots of chapstick an lotion are a must. Great product, I feel so much better about myself.\", \"After trying oral antibiotics,Ziana,Neo-Benz,and several OTC Acne meds my dermatologist put me on Amnesteem.I read all of the literature and knew the risks.This has been the only medication that has cleared my skin.I am currently in my last month of treatment.I didn't start seeing results until month 3 (of a total 6 month treatment).But it has been steady and noticeable since then.I have more confidence not having to deal with nodular Acne at 33 years old (I thought this stuff only happened to teenagers!) Having the blood tests done each month,and following the directions on prescription refills seemed to be a bit of a hassle at first but well worth it when I started noticing the results.The only side effects I have experienced in my 5 months on this medication are extremely dry lips and dry eyes.The dry eyes are relieved by eye drops once daily.The dry (extremely chapped) lips are very severe,requiring me to carry around a thick, petroleum based lip ointment and applying it between 10-15 times per day.I use Aquaphor, it seems to work the best.I have experienced no other side effects. I have a history of mild-moderate depression,but have had no adverse psychological side affects with Amnesteem (which was one of my initial concerns). Overall, I would recommend this medication for anyone that has tried every other Acne treatment available. You must want it badly enough to stay on top of all of the blood tests, monthly online surveys, and timeline in which to pick up your meds each month.\", 'I am extreamly thrilled with this product. I have been using for 4 months and I am about to start my 5th month. I have had no side effects, other than the usual dry skin. But that was to be expected. The product is clearing me up like there is no tomorrow. I am getting so many compliments on my face and how all the redness and pimples are going away. I recommend this product to all.', \"After trying many different topical and oral medications to rid myself of my Acne, my dermatologist finally put me on Amnesteem.  I wish he had done it a year ago!! The first month he started me on one 40mg per day.  I was definitely feeling the effects within the first week.  It started with bad headaches and a stiff neck, and it just kinda continued thru my whole body down to my ankles for the first two weeks. I started experiencing the dryness after about a week.  I used Cetaphil facial cleanser and moisturizer, Aquaphor lip therapy, and Aveeno body lotion.  Stock up because you'll need it! I never got bloody noses like some people mentioned, but my eyes were extremely dry so I didn't wear my contacts for long periods at a time.  The second month, my dose was upped to two 40mgs a day.  Definitely take the pill with a meal, about halfway through.  I made the mistake of taking one without eating breakfast and had heartburn so bad I literally thought I was having a heartache. I was on Amnesteem for 4 months total.  Have been off for a month and no sign of my Acne returning.  It definitely gets worse before it gets better and don't get discouraged with all the horror stories!  If you really have severe Acne and you want to get rid of it, you can deal with being uncomfortable for a few months!! It is SO worth it! The ipledge program wasn't hard to deal with and the blood work was quick and easy. Be smart while using this medicine-take no chances of getting pregnant please! This medicine, I promise, will get you the results you are looking for!\", 'I am finishing my third month and starting on my fourth month of taking this drug. It has become a lifesaver. Before I started this drug I took every topival Acne drug you think of. Anything from doxycycline to epiduo to aczone to benzacliyn and everything inbetween. This drug is very easy to use. taking it with food is better than on an empty stomach. My only side effects were chapped lips and somewhat dry skin. For my lips I use aquaphor and for my skin I use cerave. Both work great. I recommend this product to all who wantclear skin.', 'I suffered from Nodular Acne and had some scaring on the back i took amnesteem and it has helped alot. I finish my last pill about a month ago and my face is alot better and clearer. It was a huge transformation for me since i lost around 30 pounds from exercise, my Acne was clear and i gained a sense of fashion ^_^. During the treatment i suffered from drastically dry lips, it almost made me look like i was bleeding, so chapstick is a must! My dermatologist told me i didnt have to really do anything with the ipledge system only check it out if i wanted to, but i know females have to suffer by answering surveys and all that hehe ;]. And i got a really dark tan out in the sun, but it could be due to football camp in the summer so i recommend sunblock. My dandruff has disappear and i get Acne here and there maybe 1 or 2 usually when i stay up late, so sleep early, and try to make sure to eat better and clean ur face. However my sister took accutane 2 years ago and her Acne is back and she has severe break outs, but it could be the cause of the lack of sleep she gets and the food she eats. \\nGood Luck all~~', 'I was so nervous about the poss. side effects of this but as a 40 year old, having Acne was affecting my life everyday and I was willing to try it. I had VERY dry skin and chapped lips and dry nose the whole time but nothing I couldn\\'t treat. I had some hip pain for about a week and at first worried it my continue, but it went away with time and motrin. I had a few headaches that were different than my \"normal\" headaches but that got better quickly. The monthly appts. for pregnancy tests were annoying but well worth the end results. I admit I did not have severe Acne but did have hard to treat Acne all the time. Tried all the lotions and potions, birth control, spirnolactone, retin A, too. Nothing worked and having grey hair and Acne at the same time really bothered me. I stayed at 60mg per day for 5 months and 80 for the last month.  I still have some scarring but I can handle that since my skin is clear! I\\'ve been done for one month and hope I never have to stress about it again. Being able to be outside in the sun or at work with other people and not worry if they are looking at my breakouts is a wonderful feeling. If you are worried about side effects, please try the med and see how it goes. You can stop if the side effects are too troublesome but I would try it and see. I\\'m so grateful for this product. ', \"I started taking this drug when I realized that birth control pills just weren't cutting it anymore. Typically, I used the pill to prevent the obvious AND to clear up my skin. When it stopped working I sort of panicked and my skin just got worse and worse. I started breaking out in places on my face I never had in the past (chin area). After pleading with my doctor I got a referral and it took the dermatologist about 3 minutes to say that I had adult Acne and wanted to know what I had in mind to do. I made it clear I was done with Acne and had tried everything (I have) and mentioned accutane or it's generic version. He agreed that this would be a great option for me so we started at a very low dose, 10mg. I have been on 20mg/once a day for 3 months and will be on it until July or August (5 to 6 months total). Since I am on such a low dose I don't experience the same side effects a lot of other people do. However, my lips are extremely dry as in NEVER ever moisturized. And it's important to take the drug with a large meal preferably dinner or else you may experience some chest pains as I did in the beginning. If you take the drug and are responsible about it you will most likely have an OK experience. But everyone reacts differently. My lifestyle has changed since being on the drug. These changes include more water consumption, better eating habits, more sleep and very little alcohol comsumption. The drug will definitely make you feel run down but eventually with more sleep I managed to curb that side effect. My face has cleared up considerably and since I'm not quite done with treatment I usually just put on a little makeup and BAM! super nice skin. The texture of my skin as improved quite a bit and I can see the drug working. I did a ton of research before I started the drug and I encourage anyone considering this treatment to do the same. Don't let the side effects discourage you but definitely keep them in mind. \", \"I'm 14 years old, and have had sever Acne since i was 10. I was prescribed this medication after nothing else had worked. In the beginning i had all of the basic side affects and some uncommon ones as well. After about 3 weeks, all of them had dissapeared besides chapped lips. Medication was easy to take (although easy to forget to take) and cleared all of my Acne within 3 months and now it's clearing up my scars. I recommend this to any and everyone who suffers from severe Acne. You WILL NOT regret it.\", \"I struggled with Acne from the time I hit puberty (age 13) until age 24. I had managed to get it under control during my college years but when I hit 24 my face broke out like crazy and nothing I did would make the Acne go away. I finally broke down and went to a dermatologist who put me on accutane for 7 months. I'm currently on the last month of my accutane and so far it has been a blessing. My face is completely cleared up and I break out maybe once a month vs a couple times a day before I started accutane. The biggest side effects I've had are dry/chapped lips and sensitivity to products. I've been using aquafor daily and switched to Mario Badescu products that don't irritate my skin. In month 5 of the treatment I began experiencing dry skin and nose dryness (although no nose bleeding). I bought bio oil to rub on my skin for the dryness (and has helped a lot with Acne scars) and put aquafor on the inside of my nose. While all of the side effects are annoying, they are totally worth the beautiful skin I now have. I highly recommend this product.\", \"My son took Amnesteen for 6 mos.  Dosage was 60 mg. for the 1st 3 mos., then 80 mg. for the last 3 mos.  I was very nervous in the beginning about the side effects - mainly the depression.  He never had any issues with that.  Early on he was rather irritable, but after the first month or so that went away.  He had very dry/chapped lips and used chapstick endlessly throughout the day.  Stock up!  The dryness affected his whole body, so Cetaphil cleanser and face lotion, and St. Ives body lotion kept his skin from the itchiness & peeling.  He used a shampoo & conditioner with tea tree oil to help dry scalp issues.  It took a good 3 full months to see a difference in the Acne beginning to clear, and til month 5 for it to really kick in.  He just finished the full 6 months last week and in the past month, he's had maybe 2 small pimples that cleared up within 48 hrs.  He does still have pretty significant scarring.  We will go see the dermatologist in a month or two to see if there is anything further he can do about that.  Even though we are very satisfied with the results of the medication, it did not come without a price.  My son's back began hurting about 2 months after he started taking it.  After many dr. visits (chiropractic, family dr., pain dr.) and x-rays and an MRI, we found out he has 3 bulging discs in his lower back.  Could be a coincidence, however, I think it's from the medication.  The pain dr. said some people with this problem have pain, and some do not.  I think my son is having the pain because of the Amnesteen.  Of course, none of the drs we've seen can or will say the rx caused it, but rather high up in most of the side effects listings is lower back pain.  My son has always been athletic & involved in sports, and now the pain is too much for him to participate in much of anything.  A 17 yr. old shouldn't have to endure back pain like this.\", 'I have tried Accutance 3 times (currently on my last treatment).  When I was 17 in High School I had severe cystic Acne all over my face, chest and back. Took a very high dose(started at 60mg,by 5th month was on 120mg; i DO NOT recommend that)&my skin was like porcelain, absolutely NO Acne. My back and chest have stayed clear to this day, but slowly my facial Acne started to come back after 5 months so I thought I would outgrow it,WRONG. I went on it again when I was 19, but due to my doctor starting me out at 100mg, I had severe side effects (tightness in chest and difficulty breathing)& stopped the medication 1 month into it. I am now 21, still struggling with Acne, so I went to a new dermatologist and she has me on low doses for a longer period of time and the results are amazing. I still have 2 months left, but my skin has basically nothing on it. I can finally not wear makeup and feel pretty :)\\nCommon side effects: dry lips, face and skin. minor rash if in sun too long (ask doctor for a topical for rash if you get one)\\n\\n***I later found out that the brand of accutane medication my doctor put me on the second time, shortly got recalled after I stopped it. ALWAYS RESEARCH YOUR MEDICINE***\\n\\nThe best advice I can give is to ALWAYS keep hydrating chapstick on your lips(I have cracked corners of my lips and that hurts), Use a gentle face wash unscented, and as much as you want to DO NOT PICK. The medicine will bring all the Acne out of your skin and then dry it out like it is supposed to.', 'I am on my 18th day and i have noticed DRAMATIC results. I have gotten many compliments. My skin is very dry though and i do have very chapped lips but the redness of my skin has gone away and i barely breakout anymore. My Acne was pretty severe. I had tried everything (antibiotics, creams, gels, chemical peels, facials, etc.) I was very nervous about getting on this but i love it and recommend it to everyone.', \"Just finsihed a 5 month course of Amnesteen.

Same side effects...Chronically chapped lips,\\nnose bleeds, and vision changes.  My skin looks fabulous now.  No more daily oil slick by noon.  I just hope it stays this way because I can't do another course.  I also think I gained 10lbs during this period.

    "medical_condition_description":"Acne Other names: Acne Vulgaris; Blackheads; Breakouts; Cystic Acne; Pimples; Whiteheads; Zits Acne is a skin condition caused by dead skin cells sticking together and clogging up pores. Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of Acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop Acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have Acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from Acne worse than others. Bad Acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get Acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skin’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your acne. It is a myth that you have to let acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin. See a dermatologist if you feel shy or products don't work.",

    "Reviews":"[\"I am pretty sensitive to birth control so it is common for me to have side effects. I was on Sprintec with little to no problems but the pharmacy gave me mono-linyah last month. In one month my acne has flared up, my appetite has increased, I've gained about 5-7 pounds, and I feel extremely bloated and fatiqued. Everyones body reacts differently to birth controls but this is just a warning that there is a chance of having more side effects switching from Sprintec to Mono Linyah.\", \"When my usual Sprintec was out of stock at my pharmacy, they dispensed Mono-Linyah.  I've only tried it for one cycle, but I already notice some improvements.  For instance, I would always spot like crazy on Sprintec but haven't yet on Mono-Linyah.  I also feel less moody with no crying fits like I get on Sprintec.  Another great thing is my libido has increased a lot, and while I haven't had any issues with vaginal dryness, my self-lubricating mechanism seems to work even more during appropriate times.  I'd love to stay on the Mono-Linyah, but now they're out of it so I got Previfem this time.  I hope it doesn't reverse all the nice things Mono-Linyah has done for me... lol.\", \"I've been taking it for two weeks today. \\nI will do another update in another two weeks.\\n\\nI haven't been on BC for over a year, and starting this I have became more emotional. I want to cling, cuddle, and be loved on. Which I guess is normal for more females but, I am not and have never been the huggy lovable person. This is a huge 180 for me. lOl complete 360 for my fiance.\\n\\nMy acne has cleared up, I haven't noticed anything about my weight because I do work out regularly. \\nI did start this a couple days before my cycle was supposed to come which still hasn't. \\nI actually eat less, which has took me by surprise kinda.\\nMy skin seems way healthier. \\nI have experienced headaches frequently.\\nSo far I do like it. \\n\", \"I've only been on this medication a month. I haven't started my period yet but when I first started it I used it to skip my period due to vacation and I never had any break through bleeding at all. I haven't had any mood swings, or decrease in sex drive.. if any, its gotten better. I love this birth control so far. Also my acne has been clearing up a lot. :) \", \"Wow I guess this BC doesn't work for some people as well as it has worked for me. Was on Sprintec for 1 yr, now I've been on mono linyah for almost 2 years. I'm 22, no children. I love this stuff. No acne, no mood swings, no nausea,  highly regulated periods. Comes at the same time every month and they are always light and short for me (4 days). No spotting or breakthrough bleeding. Super effective as long as you take it same time every day (I take mine at 7:30 am so I don't have to worry about it the rest of the day). No copay at pharmacy for me. The pills are also so tiny that you don't really need water to swallow them, they easily go down without it. The only downside is that it would be hard to find if you dropped one (I never have though and I'm half asleep when I take them). It seems like most of these negative reviews are from the first month of taking it- I honestly can't remember my first month on mono linyah  because it was 2 years ago but maybe it eventually evens out because I have 0 complaints. I liked Sprintec fine and before that I was on Beyaz for a year, which I hated. I guess every body reacts differently. I love mono linyah, unless something dramatic happens I will continue to use it until I want to have children.\", \"HORRIBLE!!!! Worse Birth Control yet! Have been on for three months and am extremely nauseous and moody. Hopefully the next one will be better for me, because this one seriously messed with my body/hormones. Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. \", \"For whatever reason, my pharmacy switched me from sprintec to mono-linyah. I loved sprintec! Unfortunately, this was a bad switch for me. Nauesous and vomiting the first 2 days and off and on throughout the month. ALSO, I've been breaking out. I've been on approx 4 different pills before and I've never had this reaction...hoping to switch back :/\", \"I have been taking this medication for about 1 year now and I love it. I'm currently 18. It did make me moody at first and it still does if I wait too long before starting my new pack, but it eventually evens back out and I go back to normal. I'm not the best at taking it or remembering to or getting and starting my new pack right when I'm supposed to, but it still works awesome for me. It has tremendously helped my acne. I can deal with some mood swings and nausea to not have a face or body covered in acne. Overall I love this medication. I just wish I was better about taking it exactly how you are supposed to, but I am human. \", \"I tryed a different birth control and didn't like it at all. My doctor switched me to this one for birth control and acne and so far my acne has improved a lot. I love it. Nausea sometimes but it goes away quick. No weight gain. No cramps. No mood swings. So far so good. \", 'I was switched to mono-linyah from Sprintec just a couple of months ago because of a change within availability at the pharmacy. I havent noticed any majjor side effects except for my skin. I have had a lot of acne breakouts since I have been taking this. Not sure if that is a common side effect of this but I didnt have acne with the Sprintec.', 'Mono-Linyah messed with my body so much in the short month I was on it! I was moody, nauseous, had acne like a 13 year old & bled for over two weeks upon first starting it. I would NOT recommend this to anyone! ', 'I have been taking this medication for two and a half months now and I experience serious nausea everyday.  Other side effects I have had are serious breakouts and severe mood swings.  This is not worth it for me. ', \"As I'm sure you have all heard before, everybody reacts differently to birth control. The pill isn't meant to be amazing for everybody who takes it! With that in mind, my experience on this brand has been very good! In the beginning I experienced a little bit of nausea about 20 minutes after taking the pill but that went away very quickly. As long as you are on top of things and are staying aware of your body you should be able to tell if this kind of birth control is right for you. Personally, I haven't had any horrific experiences with this and it actually seems to improve some aspects of myself! For example, my skin started clearing up within the first week of taking it. This pill has been great for me! \", 'I get pretty bad cramping around the time of my period, and my period never comes on time anymore. I am also breaking out more than I did on my last BC.', \"I take it regularly for birth control and love it. It hasn't given my body any problems and has been effective!\", \"I have been taking it like I'm supposed to and I started taking the white ones I'm on my second one now and I'm still not on my period is that normal?  I also spotted a little on my last 2 blue pills. . What does that mean? Also I've been throwing up. . \", 'The medication is effective and has not caused any weight gain. It has made my periods so much better and has helped my acne however after being on it for 4 months I have started having sudden extreme depression and anxiety. I have had days in which I will cry for no reason and have up to 4 spells of this a day. I have been very anxious and just on edge. I have had panic attacks also. I never had these problems before this medication. I have also had reoccurring nausea over the 4 months of taking this medicine and I have had frequent urination, pelvic pain and dark urine which are all side effects as well. I have just stopped taking the medication the side effects were just way to much to try to tolerate. Hopefully this helps when you are choosing a birth control medication! There are so many to chose from so hopefully my doctor and I can find one with less serious side effects. ', 'i ended up with all the side affects ', 'My physician started me on a lower dose pill that caused a multitude of problems and did not help with my painful periods.  She switched me to this pill with which I a 98% satisfied.  I still have some cramping, but am able to manage the pain with Advil instead of hydrocodone or tramadol.  I have less bleeding and no PMS symptoms.   ', 'This medication works for acne,birth control etc and I didn’t have any weight gain but... I get migraines about 4-5 times a week . They’re horrible... that’s my only complaint ', 'I had spryntec for a while and got changed to this when I changed pharmacist and itbdoes its job but i get nauseous like crazy I feel very grossed and honestly I stopped talong then and went back to the dr I just cant', 'I’ve been using sprintec for a few years now. With a mix up between my GYNO & pharmacy, i was dispensed mono-linyah. I’ve never had any problems with sprintec and always request it over this version for several reasons. Mono-linyah has given me major negative side affects. I received my period 6 days early, I have been breaking out all over my face and my mood goes from 0-100. I’ve never had acne in the past. I get mood swings for no justified reason. If you are sensitive to birth controls, please read reviews and use precautions when using this product! ', \"I've been on this drug for about 5 years and been having mood swings the week before my period. But worse a few weeks ago ended up in ER with bad back and stomach pain turned out to be pancreatitis and ER doc said he linked it to my birth control med (after he looked it up as a side effect)because I am not a drinker and no other cause. Now am trying to find another med I can switch to but seriously all these meds are so bad for you...ugh! I mean I knew they weren't great but the side effects....I think I need a new plan...\\n\", 'Acme got worse ...weight gain..bloating.....breats are swollen and tender...not liking this drug', \"My doctor put me on this medication to try and regulate my very irregular period as well as help clear up my acne. I've been taking it for over two months now and whiles it helped regulate my period it's made my acne soooo much worse. It's to the point where I'd honestly rather deal with not knowing when I'm going to have my period than all the acne. Definitely not worth it so far. \", 'My breasts have grown slightly and are very sore. I am also breaking out like a mad man on my forehead, chin, and temples and i rarely break out. I was convinced i was going through a second puberty. Not sure if im quite satisfied yet. Only been on it a month.

I'm bloated all the time and it makes me tired, agitated, I've gotten more headache as nausea. Will be getting off of this pill asap.  \", 'I have been on this specific birth control for over three years now. Nearing four years. This is the third type of birth control pill that I have taken and each wind up taking this turn to where I am completely miserable taking them. Yes, I have not gotten pregnant. Yes, I have shorter/lighter periods. However, this is the only medication that I take daily and it makes me have brain fog, my anxiety is through the roof, I work out 5 days per week and eat fairly well and I cannot lose weight. My sex drive is much lower while on the pill than when I am off. I realize it is meant to regulate hormones and it has done well with birth control and periods I just feel that I need to come off of it instead of continuously pouring synthetic hormones into my body daily. I have looked into \"natural birth control\" and I will continue to look into other forms rather than this pill. My husband and I are not ready for children so we take the necessary precautions to prevent them until we are ready. I just do not know if the side effects that I have with this pill, and the other three I have tried, are worth my mental/physical health.', 'I started taking this after I had a baby, and I breastfeed. It didnâ??t affect my supply which is great but the nausea is so bad that I can barely stand up. Itâ??s everyday-all day nausea, until the 4 week when Iâ??m not actually taking the mono-linyah. Iâ??ve also noticed that Iâ??m extremely irritable and easily angered while taking this pill. Although it does itâ??s job, the side effects are not worth it.', \"Good medication. Poor packaging. I dont know hoe many pills I've lost to the ground or drain because the packaging is so difficult! Over all it works though with minimal side effects!\", \"I am on my second month of this product and it is helping with the birthcontrol portion and keeping my period regular, but my breasts continue to stay sore and sensitive along with my acne is actually getting worse. I have also found myself gaining weight and I have had body image issues in the past that had pushed me to the brink of anorexia, I just feel like I'm constantly gross. \", \"I'm not pregnant so it works! But it does have an enormous amount of side effects that has taken me almost a year to figure out. At first my periods became longer and harder with horrible cramps. I did not gain weight but my breasts were constantly sensitive. My periods have mellowed but not my mood. I have been way more emotional than I ever have been. Increased anxiety and nauseous for long periods of time off and on. Overall, it works but it will change your body somehow.  \", \"I started taking this almost 4 months ago. The first three months of naseousness was terrible. I felt it all day long but never threw up. I'm feeling much better but I do feel bloated. Didn't help much with acne. \", \"This stuff made me severely depressed. I was having serious suicidal thoughts until I went off of it. Plus the more common moodiness, clingyness, and irritability. I've been off of it a week and now I have no appetite. I've probably had 300-500 cals a day all week. If you have a history of bad reactions with BC I would avoid this one!\", \"I have been on this medication since January. I'm 37 years old and newly single. I stopped taking the pill in February (mid-cycle) and ended up in the ER with severe blood loss. It's been almost 6 months and my blood counts are still not back to normal. I began having weird symptoms that I didn't realize were side-effects to this drug (muscle aches, palpitations, dryness, vaginal odor, vaginal itching, nausea, etc.) It wasn't until I began having migraines with aura that my doctor told me to stop it immediately. I had to be tested for blood clots. All was fine. But we believe all of the weird symptoms were side effects of this drug. I've never had side effects with any drugs before. I would NOT recommend this BC to any woman over 30. I'm not even sure why my doctor prescribed it for me. I'm still having residual headaches, but overall feel so much better in just the few days that I've been off of it. \", 'THE REVIEWS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONLY TAKEN IT FOR 2 MONTHS ARE NOT VALID. I have taken it for two years and am pleased with results. I had cysts on my ovaries that would flare up whenever I was on my period. I got put on birth control pills from the same company that produces Mono-linyah. The pills look the same, but they keep changing the name of it. It was Falmina before it was Mono-Linyah. It has worked very well because I have not had any major cysts since being on this. The other reviewers do not seem to understand that it takes at least 6 packs of pills to be 100% great. I do have a few breakouts now and then, but that could just be normal for me. Recommended.', 'I have been taking this medication for close to 6 months now and the first three were very easy on me. Within the last month, it gave me really bad cramps with my cycle which I am not used too anymore. But overall I am very please with its effectiveness!!! ', 'I started taking this medication to help with my Endometriosis, Ovarian Cyst, and heavy menstrual cycles with pain. It made my very nauseous, awful acne, weight gain, and my periods were every 2 weeks. It did help with my cramps and my bleeding was very light, however, I was moody, cried my eyes out, and wanted left alone. I stopped taking this medication after month 4. ', 'I switched to sprintec and mono-linyah is the generic of this birth control. I went back on birth control because my body gets really bad cystic acne. Fortunately, my body has cleared up a lot, but my face started breaking out like crazy after starting this pill. I had a huge cystic pimple on my forehead and two on my chin for my college graduation! It really sucked. Not only was my face breaking out, but I have never experienced this much break through bleeding than I did on this pill. I had my period for three weeks! Therefore, I was not only a pizza face for my graduation, but I also had my period when I had to wear ALL WHITE! My doctor said to stick with this pill for another month, but I refuse.', \"For the first few days, nausea was BRAZY! After that, it mellowed out. My skin was never acne infested but with the pill, it got even better and I never knew why until I googled pros and cons of mono-linyah. Long story short, my gyno switched me to sprintec and I'm scared out of my mind! What if I go back to 13 year old acne infested me?! Oh no! I demand my mono-linyah NOW! ....please.\", 'SO FAR, I AM PLEASED WITH MY PRESCRIPTION.', \"I've been on this pill for months after trying multiple different birth control pills I've finally found one that eases my pain with PCOS and keeps my skin clear for the most part. My only complaint is that I'm gaining weight now and I've always been pretty small. But now I feel like I can't lose any weight like I could before I started this pill and everytime I step on the scale I weigh more! I have no change in excersize or eating habits I am pretty healthy.

Heavy bleeding, lots of pads and tampons, cramps were alright but so bad I couldn't go to school because i was bleeding so much. This is still by far the best pill I've taken.

But I would most certainly recommend mono linyah, i was on it for 2 years then it switched. \", \" The first month I used this medication I sometimes felt nauseous after taking it. I always take it before bed so that really helps. I have had some headaches as well, but I'm not sure if they're due to the BC.  I have noticed more regulated cycles which is why I began the medicine. My acne has cleared, and with a few changes in my diet, I really do feel better overall. \", \"I just got switched to this, pharmacy changed me from sprintec. At first I got a yeast infection and that wasn't very fun. Now it just makes me throw up every time I drink alcohol. That is the most awful part. Overral itis not terrible \", 'It works as far as keeping periods regular, not painful, and good birth control. However, I have gained weight.

Havent had any over side effects. I am pleased.', 'This birth control gets such bad reviews so I freaked out before I started taking it. But I gave it a chance because Iâ??ve never had bad side effects from birth control(besides implanon which caused me TERRIBLE acne.) I just started my third month on this and I havenâ??t had any bad side effects whatsoever. In fact, it completely cleared up my skin other than the occasional one pimple I get before my period. My breasts grew which is a plus for me, and I gained about five pounds which is also a plus for me. I understand thatâ??s not a plus for everyone, but for me Iâ??m definitely satisfied!', \"To start I've been on multiple birth controls orthocyclen sprintec nexplanon and now mono. I can say this birth control is definitely in my NOT list! i have had soo many side effect many with my face. my face breaks out in rashes in between my eyebrows that turn dark. They then burn after i wash my face and turn red which makes the rashes worse. my face peels like i have sunburn on my nose, forehead, and around my mouth. I can wash my face and within five minutes of washing and face cream my face is peeling. Recently my nose started itching like a feather was under it. Its going in the trash today! To those that are skeptical in believing it's the birth control, i was to so i came off of it for a month all symptoms went away. I however slipped up once drunk night with my boyfriend and started another  pack to keep from pregnancy. oh n my acne is horrible with these pills as well.     \", 'Stay away from Mono-Linyah. My pharmacy changed its generic BC pill to monolinyah from Sprintec a few months ago. I never had 1 single unpleasant side effect from Sprintec, which I had been taking for 4 & a 1/2 straight years. On the first day I took one of the pills, within an hour I had a migraine & was nauseous. This persisted off and on for weeks and months, and got worse and worse, to the point where I was vomiting and my stomach burned. I stopped taking it and went back to Sprintec, and have felt completely normal, happy and regular periods, no mood swings, nothing. The pharmacists/ doctors claim they are the same because they contain the same hormones/dosage. but the coating on MonoLinyah I believe is what causes all these awful side effects. I would also recommend eating a good meal, taking Prilosec, fish oil & a probiotic prior to your pill, and take it the same time every day. This is what helped me with my sensitive stomach. Hope this helps !', 'I chose Mono-Linyah for acne. At first I was a hormonal mess and had anxiety about everything. After about 4 months my hormones leveled out, and my acne cleared. Almost a year into it now and my acne is basically gone. My breasts did enlarge some and cramping in my periods has gotten a bit worse. Other than that I have had no other side effects.', \"I was switched to this BC and I'm not sure why but it has been an awful experience. I started in the first 3 months with the neaseau and thought well it's just the transition period. I ignored the anxiety attacks saying I was just stressed. I decided I was doing better since the anxiety attacks had slowed but then the depression set in and I found myself disappointed because I had failed to cut myself at work on broken glass from a broken frame we had revived. Needles to say I'm getting off of this BC. On top of all of this periods are becoming more painful again which is why I started BC to begin with. I'm far from pleased. \", 'I woke up depressed most mornings, but felt better by mid morning. My usual nervousness with the pill was better with this one.

(I tried at least 12 other estrogen formulations and had no luck dealing with menopause symptoms and feeling like myself.) Since it went generic, NOT ONE of the companies making it produces a product that works synergistically the same way. A big part of the reason they stopped making the brand was the boneheaded decision of the FDA to refuse to approve this drug when it's the only one that some women like me can use. The same effect cannot be achieved by separate applications and/or doses of the two combined drugs in it. And now since the methyltestosterone part is being more strictly regulated, I have to get a new subscription for it every 6 months even though there's only a teeny amount of the male hormone in this formulation.

    "medical_condition":"Acne",
    "medical_condition_description":"Acne Other names: Acne Vulgaris; Blackheads; Breakouts; Cystic acne; Pimples; Whiteheads; Zits Acne is a skin condition caused by dead skin cells sticking together and clogging up pores. Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from acne worse than others. Bad acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skin’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your acne. It is a myth that you have to let acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin. See a dermatologist if you feel shy or products don't work.",

    "Reviews":"[\"I’m a 23 year old female who has had acne issues since about 12 years old.  Topicals like Differin got me through my teen years until my adult acne started up around age 21.  I tried an antibiotic called Solodyn, which worked wonderfully, but isn't a permanent fix unless you want to take it every day for the rest of your life.  My doctor told me my long-term struggle with acne made me a prime candidate for Accutane, specifically a kind called Absorica.  After reading all of the information, scary possible side effects, and additional side effects for women who get pregnant while on the drug, I was a little nervous but ultimately decided that my overall good health made me a prime candidate.  I'm so glad I tried it.  After just 5 months, my nodular acne is gone and even my blackheads I've had on my nose and chin since 12 years old have disappeared.  My complexion is clear and I never thought it could be this way given my history with acne.  Though the side-effects are scary and there are a lot of negative reviews online, I suggest you do your own research and make a decision based on you and you alone.  I couldn't be happier with the results and am glad I decided to take the leap.  With the monthly blood work and checkup with your doctor, I feel as though severe health problems would be apparent and action could be taken before anything serious happened.  This is merely my opinion, but I wanted to make sure I shared my positive experience because it seems like reviews online are mostly negative and I don't think they accurately reflect what the drug can do if taken properly by a healthy person who is monitoring their health along the way.\", 'I am on my 4th month of absorbica. My first month i was on 40 mg and my skin cleared up after the first month! I have dry lips, dry eyes, and sometimes get lower back pain, but it is sooo worth it! I have no acne and feel so confident. It is pretty hard to stay out of the sun and not drink, but I know it will be worth it in the long run :) My dr says my skin looks perfect, but wants me to stay with the 6 month treatment time just so my pores are for sure trained to not produce too much oil like before. I give this medication 5 stars! ', 'I am just starting my second month of Absorica, and so far the only cons is the dry lips, and dry skin. I have also developed eczema. On the plus side, my acne and the severity of it has decreased significantly, which is a huge plus. My skin is very sensitive to sunlight now, so I definitely recommend sunscreen. So far, so good. I will post again when I complete my course, which is 5 months.', \"I'm on my 14th or 15th day and so far my acne isn't as bad, but there are some acne still developing. My dermatologist said it would get worst before it got better. My skin on my face and hands are dry. I've had really bad chapped lips to the point where they split, but that's because I was in DC for the first few days and I didn't have my Vaseline. Using Vaseline or the Vaseline lip therapy (balm) helps a lot! I've noticed one day that the corners of my mouth got really cracked and they are swollen and hurt really bad and I have a difficulty eating, drinking and talking. I've tried Lotrimin Anti Fungal to help it and it helped a little and then they started to come back. I might have this issued because I have an iron deficiency at times and that can be a cause. My dermatologist told me that I should be seeing results within 12 weeks if not sooner because my skin is already drying out from the IC Spironolactone \", 'I started out with sever acne that scarred. I am on my fifth month of absorbica and have loved what it has done to my skin. Though my akin is dry I have had the referral to use aquaphor for my dryness. This drug has made my skin look as it should without acne. Please note that this drug makes your skin very sensitive do not stay outside in the sun without sunscreen because you will burn twice as fast. ', \"Went from mild acne to the WORST case of acne ever.  Months of being on this drug with million times worst (is there even such a thing - was in my son's case).  Finally the doctor listened and switched him to clarvis and within a couple of weeks it cleared but not before absorica wrecked his self esteem and left him with scars that will need to be corrected through resurfacing.  We are not dramatizing what actually happen.  Absorica is the worst of the worst.  \", 'My son is on his 4th month of Absorica and finally starting to see real results.  He took a 6 month course of a generic Accutane one year ago.  Initially the first course of medicine brought results but four months after completion of the 6 month treatment his acne returned worse than ever.  His dermatologist recommended trying Absorica.  He is finding less side effects with Absorica.  Previously he experienced extremely dry lips and skin, extremely achy joints and muscles,  headaches and terrible hang nails (to the point of experiencing pain when picking up items or accidentally hitting his hands or fingers). With Absorica his lips are not nearly as dry and he is hardly experiencing the muscle and joint pain. His skin is dry and flaky so he applies moisturizer several times a day and he just started to develop a painful hang nail but not nearly as bad as last time.  Sun burn with both medicines (Absorica and Accutane generics)is always a concern so lots of sunscreen is used when going outside.', 'Letâ??s start out by saying I am not the typical patient.  I am a 47-year-old male in good shape.  I have had acne my whole life and I have controlled it through a variety of ways (Lotions, antibiotics, etc.) Last year I developed Nodular acne mostly on the back of my head.  The acne was painful and causing headaches and would sometimes bleed on my pillows.  I started Absorica exactly 5 weeks ago and my skin, including back of my head, is significantly better.  My Triglycerides level on my blood tests has risen but is still in the normal range.  To maintain the level, I have committed to less sugar and low carb diet.  The combination is supposed to lower the Triglycerides.  So far so good.  I will report back next month.', \"\\nHello everyone I just started Absorbca for my face today at 40mg. I'm very very nervous. I just took my first dose. I'm afraid of the mental health side effects. I'll deal with the dry skin and muscle pains and even severe breakouts.. I just don't want the mental health side effects. My doctor laughed and told me that's the least of my worries I should be nervous about that.\", 'I USED AMNESTEEM A GENERIC ACCUTANE FOR MONTHS WITH NO SUCCESS. MY ACNE WORSENS, I HAD DEEP CYSTS AND THE BUMPS ACTUALLY OOZED! I AMA FEMALE,  OVER 50 AND NEVER EVEN HAD ROSECEA ISSUES UNTIL I HIT MY 40S. THIS LAST TIME IT WAS AWFUL AND SPREAD OVER MOST OF MY FACE. EVEN WITH MAKEUP I DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE   ', \"So grateful for this medicine!  Been under treatment for five months for Rosacea with minocycline  which only helped the redness, not the bumps and swellings.   Now using Absorica four weeks with dramatic results. Taking 20 mg a day with no side effects.  30+ years ago I took Accutane 80 mg per day for five months to treat stubborn cystic acne and it worked!  I endured terrible side effects at that dosage, such as lips peeling in chunks, pink eye for two months and generalized dryness throughout my body. Almost gave up numerous time but managed to hang in and glad I did.  All these years later I'm being helped by an isotretinoin again - this time no side effects at all with the lower dosage.  If you suffer from persistent rosacea, consider Absorica. It's a miracle for me. \"]",

    "medical_condition":"Acne",
    "medical_condition_description":"Acne Other names: Acne Vulgaris; Blackheads; Breakouts; Cystic acne; Pimples; Whiteheads; Zits Acne is a skin condition caused by dead skin cells sticking together and clogging up pores. Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from acne worse than others. Bad acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skin’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your acne. It is a myth that you have to let acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin. See a dermatologist if you feel shy or products don't work.",

Third month, began 120mg daily (two pills in the morning, one in the evening).  I've seen some very slight improvement in the past few days but far from being cured.  I have very light skin so every pimple scar shows.  So with scars and constantly getting fresh pimples, it's been extremely embarrassing.

I have had severe Acne since I was 11 years old. I have scars all over my face. I went to doctor after doctor dermatoligist after dermatologist and no one recomended this to me. I did the research myself. The first month on the pills I didnt not notice anything, I was so sad. I thought it was not going to work then in the second month I could see my skin clearing up DAILY. It was my miracle. 5 months later I did not have one pimple on my back face or chest, all places I had breakouts before. I would recomend this to anyone. I tried every drug you can name, I tire every thing at the stores in the face wash, pill, cream isles. I ordered everything off tv comericals. This pill was my saving grace. My 6 year old daughter came up to me not too long ago and said mommy you dont have those \"ow ees\" on your face anymore. Its pretty- and she touched my face. I would recomend this to anyone who suffered Like i did. (I had no bad side effects. I did have chapped lips - the whole 5 months but nothing lip balm in every coat pocket could not handle. And towards the end I did notice some joint pain in my knees, but it was so worth it) I would do it again in a second.', \"I'm a 26 yo male. Since 16, I've always had acne breakouts, ranging from mild to severe. I'm currently in law school and about 6 mo. ago I had about the worst breakout I’ve ever experienced.\\nInitially I tried treating the acne with over the counter topical meds, including Neutrogena, MaxClarity, and Murad. Nothing worked!! Eventually I went to my doctor and asked for Doxycycline. I had taken this antibiotic on two prior occasions for a period of 2 months each with great results. My doctor prescribed a dosage of 100 mg and I took that for 3 moths with little improvements. He also prescribed adapalene cream 1%, an expensive $200 tube that did nothing for me. After 3 months I decided to go to a dermatologist who only increased the dosage to 200 mg and prescribed a benzyl peroxide wash ($50) that dried my skin and did not get rid of the stubborn nodules I had. After 2 months of that regimen I went back and my dermatologist who finally prescribed Claravis (isotretinoid - “accutane”).\\nI began with a Claravis dosage of 40 mg/day on and after the first day I began to notice a difference. The inflamed nodules began to go down and my skin look a bit better. By the fifth day, the improvements were obvious! I am on my tenth day and so far the improvements continue. I've had a couple of breakouts but nothing major and definitely nothing like it was before. I’d like to think that like every acne treatment, it is expected since the medication is “pushing out” the acne that has already formed but hasn’t yet hit the skin surface. \\nSome of the side effects I am experiencing include dry mouth and lips and perhaps a bit of unusual tiredness. However, I am by no means depressed or suicidal! In fact, my self-esteem has improved tremendously. I am happy to say that this has been a very positive experience thus far and I hope to finish the treatment with the same momentum. \", \"I was not really nervous to start Claravis but more eager than ever to try it!  I have had acne since high school and although it wasn't the worst acne, I still suffered from self esteem issues because of it.  I tried just about everything like everyone else.  I had enough when I was papering for my wedding and I couldn't handle acne and what could possibly show up on my wedding day, so I went on Claravis.  I got the same side effects like everyone else (dry lips & skin) but that was about it!  I always made sure I ate breakfast and then took the pill so I didn't get sick and kept SPF on while in the sun.  No issues!  It did take a little longer for me to see results- about month 4 my skin was perfect!!  I hit a stage Iike they say (month 3) when it gets worse before it gets better..I was very frustrated but I knew it would work, just to be patient.  I used to have to blot my face with an oil sheet an hour after putting makeup on, now I can go an entire day without my makeup being messed up or oily.  I can go more than a day without washing my hair and it still looks good!  I'm extremely thankful for this product and recommend it to anyone that is as frustrated as I was.  It's a pain to get your blood drawn and a urine test every month but so unbelievably worth it.  I had no mood swings, no aches and pains, no weight gain and had great results!! \", \"This medication had done everything it has promised, but it hasn't been easy.  The first month i took one 30mg pill and for the past three months I have been taking two a day.  After two months it began working and by the third month my skin was looking great.  However, the side effects for the past month have been awful.  Not including the dryness and nose bleeds, but the mood swings, hair thinning, crying spells, withdrawn from my family, and outburts have been awful.  I am very even-tempered, so this is extremely out of character for me.  I have a month left and cant wait to be done.  However, I wouldn't change anything, having clear skin is amazing as has greatly improved my confidence.  I am almost 30 and have never been able to look in the mirror without counting atleast 5-10 blemishes and now i have none...yes, none!!\", \"Hi, I'm 17 years old and i've been taking Claravis for the past month (40mg) once a day! Tomorrow I get a new prescription with a higher dosage. I am satisfied so far because in the beginning my face was so oily and now its drying out! Some say that I am crazy for wanting my face to be dry! I experienced dry chapped lips, dry skins, back pain, i've been a little irratable but overall good! I take this medicine with prozac so that kind of substitutes the depression part! I recommend this completly but be aware to always keep your skin moisturized! I recomment Avenno and Eucerin; drink plently of water, and always always ALWAYS keep chap stick on because your lips will dry out so much they will split! So even if your lips or skin isn't so dry moisturize it anyway! HOPE IT HELPS\", \"I have been on claravis for 6 months and my acne have cleared.  I had cystic acne and it has cleared.  The only thing is that my lips got very dry, eyes were dry and inside of nose was so dry that it would bleed.  When I used car ex for my lips throughout the day my lips were fine.  Artificial tears for eyes and drinking lots of water helped.  Also Vaseline inside my nostrils kept my nose from drying out and bleeding.  It also caused eczema on my arms but Vaseline would keep it under control.  I also had joint and muscle pain so I stopped exercising until I am done with medication.  Even though it was rough taking this medication it was worth it.  I don't miss those big ugly pimples!

As far as side effects, my lips have been very chapped and the skin around my mouth has been dry, other than that there's no adverse side effects. The pill is easy to take.\\n\\nSo far I am satisfied with the results. I still have several pimples on my face but I'm encouraged that in a few months they will all be gone.

After just two weeks, my skin was completely clear and in the three months I've been on it, I have had maybe three breakouts. It's fantastic. I play rugby so the muscle sorness and joint pain is exaggerated, and dryness around my mouth and lips. Just lotion and moisturize often.

Side effects include: severe constipation and flatulant retention, dry face and scalp (don't mind at ALL!), dry lips, nose, mouth and eyes, back pain, excessive sweating when working out, loss of appetite, stomach aches, blurred vision (especially at night) and dizziness. I take a weight loss supplement along with Claravis (not advised by my Dr.) and yet my labs are still within range. Organs are fine it's just my body that is feeling the effects I guess.

Chapstick became my best friend and I learned to use Vaseline if I felt like taking a bowel movement.

I am getting weird pains here and there and chalk it up to side effects.  You sort of second guess yourself in the beginning.  I am worried for sure about the long term effects and all the short term ones as well.  I feel a little paranoid at every little ache or pain as well.  Acne is debilitating when it is longterm and bad enough to go through all the crazy things we have to go through just to get a script filled.  Esp. woman.  I should start praying a little extra for myself and everyone out there on claravis.

I will say that the side effects i've had thusfar are: joint aches (knees, arms), minor fatigue, ashy/rashy skin on arms legs, and of course the chapped lips (if you use lip gloss on a regular basis like me, you won't have many issues with this). Ibuprofen and Tylenol can be taken for the pain and inflammation under the arms, groin, and other areas that are affected. I use Hawaiin Tropical SPF 50+ Sunscreen when i'm outside which will help the sensitivity to the sunlight.

I wish you all well!\", \"I'm a 30 year old male who's had minor to moderate acne since I was a teen, and have spent so much money on over the counter things over the years. I finally went to a dermatologist and was on antibiotics, but still didn't completely clear up my face, and chest, which just started in the last year. I was hesitant to go on isotretinoin because of all the side effects I heard and read about. Got worse first 2 weeks like it said, but after 3 weeks it's completely cleared up my chest and almost my face. I can see my pores on my nose getting smaller, and my face is getting smoother.\\nAt first there was some minor lower back pain, but it's rare now. I do have chapped lips, but Aquaphor lip balm once an hour or so helps. My face gets dry at  but I moisturize twice a day with Eucerin or Cerave lotion. I do sunburn very easily, so should have done it in the fall/winter, but I usually burn pretty easily anyway, picked up SPF100 sunscreen.\\nOverall, I'm still fairly early in the treatment, but it seems like a miracle drug so far. Haven't had any kind of depression or mood swings, actually have been in  a better mood than I have been in a long time. I really wish I would have done it earlier, could have saved alot of scarring, pain, money, and overall stress. \\n\", 'I am a 40 year old African American female, I took Accutane for 6 mos. about 17yrs ago,It worked wonders and I experienced no side effects. I just moved to the west coast about 2yrs ago and have started experiencing cystic acne on face and back, I am about to satrt taking Clarivis 40 MG once a day and I hope it works as well as the Accutane did 17yrs ago, like a few people have said the medicine is very effective but I guess it wears off every 10-15 years, when I started the Accutane the Dr told me that it was a permanent cure but I guess not, however it was well worth it. I will keep you guys posted as to how well the Clarivis works.', \"I began with very deep, bumpy acne on my cheeks and chin area. It just looked like bumps on my face. By the beginning of month 2, I had very dry skin. During the next several months, I experienced very chapped lips, dry eyes, occasional rashes on the backs of my hands, and dry patches of skin on my arms and legs. I also experienced fatigue, headaches, and some nausea around the same time every day (3-4 hours after taking medicine). My acne got worse, then better as the treatment progressed. By month 4, most of the acne was gone, with only deep acne remaining on my chin and lower cheeks. It's month 6 (last month) and I'm 99% acne-free. IMPORTANT: Take this medicine with meals - one time I did not and woke up with severe vertigo and nausea for 24 hours. \", \"I am a 56 year old male.  I was on Accutane in 1980 and on it again in 1995.  Now in 2010, I am heading into my second month on Claravis (pretty much the same as Accutane) and experiencing the same side effects;  dry chapped lips, dry skin, dry scalp, irritability and fatigue...but...it is all worth it if you have bad acne.  In my case, both times I have taken it, it has done wonders.  I ended the regimen with completely clear skin.  The problem is, it doesn't necessarily last.  You may need to take it every 10-15 years to maintain clear skin.  A few tips:  Try Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion.  If you're going to be out in the sun, by all means use a sunscreen (I use Cetphil SPF 15).  For dry lips, I recommend Kiehl's No-Shine Moisturizing Lip Balm -- it works wonders.  Aquaphor Healing Ointment is great to smear on your lips and other excessively dry areas before bed.  Best of luck to you.  It is a tough regimen...but I believe you will find it is worthwhile in the end.\", 'Been taking Claravis 30mg for 2 weeks so far.  Week 1, dry lips.

Makes it difficult to open the mouth to eat.  He has had a slight change in his demeanor.  He is aggitated easier.  His acne is responding well with his face responding better than his back.  He takes 40 mg. twice daily.  His nose is also dry, causing nose bleeds.  He has had his second blood draw to check for elevated cholesterol (results not known at this time).', 'I am a 26 year old female that has experienced deep, painful cystic acne since age 13. I had no problem dealing with the inconvience or unattractiveness of my acne until this last year when my skin became so sensitive to the touch that putting sunscreen on my back was excruciatingly painful. I had up till this point tried every topical ointment, cleanser and oral antibiotic. I tried every diet alteration in which I eliminated dairy and wheat. But I reached a point when I realized it’s all genetics and out of my control and I think that’s what’s important to remember, acne can’t be controlled, there is no rhythm or reason, it just is. \\n   After outweighing the side effects I started taking Claravis as a last resort. I started on 30mg, twice daily and immediately started feeling a difference in my skin smoothness within two days but I also immediately felt the moisture being extracted from my skin. I drank four liters of water on my second day of treatment. My skin on my back and face began shedding large amounts of skin within the third and fourth day, and my lips despite constant application of Vaseline peeled and split. Eating and smiling became extremely painful.  I am a rock climber and yogi, and immediately experienced joint pain in my fingers and had to back off training and practice. At this point on day eight my doctor dropped my dose down to 30mg once daily because the side effects were becoming worse than the acne itself.\\n   DO NOT drink alcohol on this medication, alcohol is a diuretic which makes you more dehydrated, it also messes with glucose levels, and puts more strain on your liver. I began hallucinating after half a bottle of beer. Not recommended.

Had many different medications, mostly Erthromycins, and various treatments with little or no lasting benefits.  A dermatologist prescrescribed Claravis treatment starting Nov 2009, up to a maximum of 60 mg per day. for a month. The worst side effects for me was dry mouth, dry chapped lips and slight difficulty in sleeping more than 5-6 hours nightly.  This medication was worth any amount of it's cost because my acne dissappeared and my skin cleared after the second month (Dec 09)of treatment.  I cannot say enough good things about Claravis, it helped my skin problem more than any other medications I ever taken.\", \"I have seen some amazing results from people who have taken Claravis, who had minimal problems with side-effects, if they even had any. This drug isn't anything to be played around with though, patients should be aware of all the possible side-effects and weigh the benefits with the risks. I have had acne since I was 10 years old, it has progressively gotten worse and after nearly every other treatment possible, Claravis was my last resort. Within the first month and a half, I noticed a pretty good improvement in my acne, but I had to stop treatment early due to side-effects. Not only I, but others noticed a complete change in my personality. I was irritable, unable to focus, constantly jittery and nervous. I couldn't even make simple decisions, and I was afraid to be left alone. I also started suffering from severe panic attacks: at home, in stores, in the classroom, they would even wake me in my sleep. They eventually led me to the emergency room. I have been off Claravis for about seven months now, and with the help of other medication I am about back to normal. Even with the short amount of time I was on Claravis, I still notice a change in my acne. Although I still have a decent amount of acne, I tend not to suffer from the painful nodular acne as much, and the acne on my arms and back has ceased to exist. I also had a problem with hair loss, which is a common side-effect, but that went away about a month after stopping treatment. There is no denying that Claravis works, but just make sure to take the side-effects seriously. \", \"I am a parent of a son who went through the treatment for difficult to cure acne.  We knew of the potential side effects, but decided to try it anyway.  His acne is almost completely gone, but he became almost suicidal, and his grades dropped from A's and B's to D's and F's.  The cracked lips and dry skin were a minor inconvenience, but the emotional toll of this medicine is much more than we expected. Please do not take this medication lightly.  We threw the medication out after about 3 months.  This medicine was effective in clearing the acne, but the side effects are horrible for teens.  A decrease in grades effects ability to get into a good college.  The depression can be severe.  Thank GOD  we tossed the medication before an actual suicide attempt.  \", \"This has been my 4th month on Claravis, and i'm very pleased. It has taken away most of my acne, but still have a little left to go. I have the usual side effects of dry lips, mouth, and hands. I had to have some special lotion for my hands, they were so bad. It has made my face much less oily, along with my hair. You just can't do vigorous exercise, otherwise you might experience joint pain. It took the first couple of months to get rid of the redness on my face. I never experienced the phase, 'it's worse before it gets better.' For me it only got better since i took it. But overall, it has been a great drug for me. It could be different for every person, though. \", \"I went on a 6 month treatment of Claravis! It worked wonders, my skin looks amazing and so much less oily.I  did get chapstick for my chapped lips and lotion for my extreme dry skin.It was worth it in the end, even though I did experience mood swings as well as joint pain.

I would not change using it though!  \", 'I am a 23 yr old female and today I start my second round of Claravis. I had amazing success the first round, but unfortunatly may acne came back about 8 months after being off the medications. Of course I had cracked/dry lips and dry skin, but I already had dry skin to start. but the worst and most frightening thing is I had crying spills and panic attacks for NO REASON. I have always been super outgoing/confident (minus the acne part) and talkative. But this medication makes me super moody, fatigued and tired. So my advice for the females, is to let people know that is a side effect if they start asking you why are you crying. Also, stay in close contact with someone is always a wise idea, especially if you live alone. My cholesterol and triglyceride levels skyrocketed at the end of my round but went down afterwards. Irregardless of my diet (I am a nutritionist).  My advice- drink LOTS of water, buy nasal moisturizer, always have a good chapstick, cerevae thick cream for face, get plenty of sleep.

I've never experienced anything like this before so I'm in high hopes that this works. With this, I have gotten the side-effects of chapped lips and dry skin, but not any sort of depression or mood swings which is good because I'm a really outgoing person. I take 40mg tablets, one a day. I recommend that if you are taking Claravis to stay out of the sun as much as possible, because it does make your face more red and tends to swell up a bit.

I tried every tetracycline possible, topical meds and so on but nothing worked. This medicine has turned my life around. I have clear skin (maybe a small pimple here or there but NO big bumps). I have dry lips, flaky skin and sore joints but VERY much worth it in my opinion. I now wear short sleeves and less cover up on my face. Everyone notices how clear my skin is and my confidence is UP. I was a little worried about the side effects at first, but if you talk to your doctor (truthfully!) about anything that might be a problem (like family depression) and get it out there, then they can help you make the decision.

The worst side effect is the chapped, peeling lips. Burts Bee's works the best for him.\", 'Day 16,  I no longer have the sunburn sensation and my face isn’t as red (my face looks like I’ve been in the sun, but not sunburned).  My hair is still not oily and I’ve found that I have to condition it at least every other day to keep moisture in it.  Best of all: Vaseline has worked wonders on my chapped lips.  I’ve read that some users are buying over-the-counter strength lip balms, but Vaseline is cheap and honestly does the trick – my lips don’t feel as numb nor do I have chunks of skin peeling off them every 5 minutes.   They sell a tiny plasic jar (about 1 inch by 1 inch), so you can take it everywhere with you an apply as needed…like every 20 minutes.\\n\\nAlso, I recommend Cetaphil lotion for the dry skin.  It truly lasts a really long time and doesn’t cause you to break out (which amazes me because I have never been able to apply any kind of moisturizer or lotion to my face because it clogs my pores).  The problem I have, though, is that it makes your face shiny.  I have been applying it at night to cut down on the drying, peeling skin that happens over night.  I apply it to my dry problem areas in the morning, but not to my entire face.   I then cover it with a powder made by Clinque that hides the redness.  It works.  I’m female, but I bet a guy can use it too without anyone detecting he is wearing concealer.  It will give your skin a matte finish after you apply the lotion to your face.  Clinque is expensive (about $35 for the powder), but I bet Target or similar stores carry a yellow-based powder that cancels out the redness.  I had to stop using my Clinque liquid concealer made for acne sufferers because the combination of the makeup and the drug was causing a burning sensation from drying out my skin even more.\\n', \"I have been on Claravis for 16 days now (60mg dosage per day).  Although I haven't been on the drug very long, I can already see results.  The first 5 days, nothing physically changed.  But as I reached Days 6 through 13, my side-effects were terrible.  First came the chapped lips.  If you’re about to start this drug, be warned.  It’s horrible.  They were chapped to the extent that I was trying every imaginable product sold by Target, and re-applying the balm every 5 minutes).  That same day I started having dry flakey skin on my face that would re-appear within 30 minutes after having just cleared it.  The next day (as the first 2 symtoms continued), I had a TERRiBLE sensation that my face was sunburned, especially my forehead.  I was also very red, despite not being outdoors for long periods of time.  Other minor side-effects are itchiness and dry eyes, but I haven’t had to use any additional lotions or eyedrops as it hasn’t become annoying yet.\\n\\nMy face did break out more than usual, but it’s only been like that for about a week and it’s starting to clear.  The sunburn sensation lasted about 5 days.  Within 10 days, though, the most amazing side-effect took place: non-greasy hair for the first time in my life.  I typically have to wash my hair every day, sometimes twice.  The other day, I woke up, went to get ready for my shower, looked in the mirror and realized, “I don’t have to wash my hair, it looks the same as it did yesterday – not oily at all!” (although, I still took a shower because who wants to have beautiful hair yet stink like a pig?)  \\n\\n\", \"In short, I am not getting any new acne which is fantastic, but there is a lot of scarring on my back from dealing with deep cystic and nodular acne for so long. It was my fault for not going this route sooner. So I'm glad I took Claravis, but it was no picnic. My biggest symptoms were burning dry/red eyes, super chapped lips, and hair loss. I've never been on any sort of hard prescription drug so this was all new to me. Basically those 3 symptoms got so bad around the end of month 5 that I took myself off of it. I know I know.... I'm a quitter, but I was getting scared I wouldn't get my hair back. It had thinned quite a bit. And I was concerned about my eyes being permanently damaged. I probably needed another couple months to clear up some of the larger nodules on my back that have been there for years, but oh well. Like I said, I haven't had any new pimples so I'm happy about that. It's been 8 months since I got off of it. My hair has finally fully returned! It took almost a full 8 months though. My lips are still fairly dry. I use AQUAPHOR LIP REPAIR on the bad days. That's good stuff. My eyes are still dry as well. I wear contacts but have to wear glasses a lot more often now. In my experience, eye drops have not helped at all. After putting several $20 or $30 bottles of oily drops in there, I can say firmly that nothing worked. The only thing that seems to help my eyes is drinking more water. I probably should have just lowered my dosage and kept going, but oh well I didn't know what I was doing and my doctor was really not very helpful. \", \"My skin has gotten pretty dry, but not so bad that putting on lotion after a shower doesn't fix. I have also got nose bleeds pretty frequently in my first month. My hair is a lot less oily and my acne has cleared up considerably.\", \"I was on claravis 40mg twice daily for 4 months march-june. I am writing because I was one of them that had side effects. I tuffed it out during the 4 months with PAIN in joints. I have never hurt so bad. Now that is october I am still having trouble with constipation. I even went to the doctor for RLQ pain/tender they did a CT that lead to severe constipation how embarrassing but I was taking 2 fiber pills a day. I still hurt everyday in that certain area. My R knee hurts more I guess this med can have joint side effects like calcifications. I went to the doctor in late july with tendonitis R wrist. I hadn't done anything to it, just started hurting and couldn't lift up heavy objects. I have more scars on my face because it drys you up so quickly that it depresses some areas. Now I can't have any peels microdermabasion to even it out for a while because the potential to scar it at severe risk. I haven't had any deep acne though. Just small whiteheads throughout. I wouldn't go back on it at all. Just drink alot of water while on it. EVERYTHING dries up even your va-j-j women.\", 'After 3 weeks of treatment, my lips are severly chapped, and peel and blled almost daily.  Frequent vaseline helps.  I have started getting nosebleeds and some blood in my stool - but nothing unbearable...hopefull I can make it another 3 months without anything worse than this.  My skin looks good so far...no major breakouts.', 'My skin is clearing up slowly. I am in my 3rd month and getting a little frustrated. very dry lips and skin, some rashes on my arms, HAVE to wear sunblock all the time, some joint pain, headaches, i also get aggitated very easily(not like me at all). And its kinda expensive. But if i works in the end, it will all be worth it! :)Good luck to all users!', 'I have been taking claravis 40mg twice a day, my skin cleared within a month. I am now in my 4th month and my face is breaking out, my lips and face are dry,I lift weights my knees hurt and now my hair is falling out and I have to wear glasses. I have been told to take fish oil and Biotin to help with my hair. Has anyone else lost there hair? ', 'I am going into my 3rd month of claravis and having joint and muscle pains. Dry nose w/nose bleeds. I have crawly sesations all over my body and get anxiety from it because i didnt know what it was. I stopped taking the medicine for a couple of days and it still feels like little crawlys. Anyone else experiencing this? I want to continue the medicine because of how great my skin looks, but whoaaaaa the anxiety! ', 'I have been dealing with acne for about 10 years. After using every topical and pill form I finally decided to try this. I was on Accutane for 5 months and the first month was awful. I had even worse break outs and then it cleared up and my skin looked great! Then a year later it started creeping back. So I did another treatment for 6 or 7 months and the same thing happened. I\\'ve been medication free for a little over a year and I am still struggling!!! Plus I have bowel problems now! This drug has so many awful side effects and I figured if I tried it twice, whether it worked or not I wouldn\\'t put my body through that ever again. All the toxins from this are not worth it especially when the acne came back... Now I am eating better and using infrared sauna to sweat out toxins and doing acupuncture treatments. Hopefully that will work but I don\\'t recommend this drug! IT\"S POISON!!!', \"I knew that if I got pregnant while taking this medicine it could deform the baby, but what I didn't know is that taking this drug could cause me never to be able to have a baby. I have been dealing with severe pelvic pain since about 2 months after being on the drug. I am 25 years old and would like to have kids some day. The pain is coming from my ovary area. I never even though to correlate the symptom until I brought it up to my derm and he told me it is in fact a side effect and immediately took me off of the drug. My skin is cleared up, but at what cost? Now, I have to have all kinds of tests done and hope that I will still be able to have kids. Not worth it.  \", \"I am the reviewer directly below who took 16 tablets of 20mg Claravis. All of the negative side effects have since ceased, and acne has slowly returned. However, it is much, much more mild and is no longer embarrassing to any degree. Be careful if you are considering taking this drug and notice any serious side effects, whether documented or not (doctors say mine weren't, but enough people reported the problem). It truly is an extremely powerful drug but has a ridiculous amount of possible side effects. \", \"I was on claravis (20mg) for a little over two weeks (took 16 tables) and my acne has completely disappeared from my body and face. Had some side effects, such as severely chapped lips while on it, which was okay. The day or two after I stopped, I had my first outbreak of HSV-1 ever (at the sight of the previous lip dryness), and now, a week later, it is difficult for me to maintain an erection. I no longer wake up with morning wood, which is something I've had probably for the past 10 years. My hair also no longer gets greasy, so if I don't shower for 3 days, it's completely unnoticeable, whereas before it was noticeable the next morning.\\n\\nThe dryer or less greasy hair is acceptable for me. The clear skin is great. The ED or beginning stages of it is so heartbreaking at this point in my life, and my girlfriend has noticed it too. For clear skin, this was definitely NOT worth it. I would rather my face look like the Himalayan Mountains than have to deal with this at 20 years old. If the side effects are only temporary, such as less than one month, I will change my satisfaction to 4 stars instead of 0. I will update this in one month\", 'I\\'m a seventeen year old girl and I\\'m on my second month of Claravis. I am taking 30mg twice a day. I\\'ve had the basic side-effects. Severely dry skin, chapped lips, sore joints, and a touch of mood swings. However, my father and brother were both on Accutane and tell me that its worth sticking it out. They haven\\'t had any acne for years, so I\\'m going to take it that it really works. I\\'m in the \"it gets worse before it gets better\" stage. So, as a warning to anyone else who wants to take Claravis, your skin WILL get worse within the first couple of months. I have acne worse right now than I ever did. But everyone assures me it\\'ll go away within a month. ', 'My son started Claravis 40mg 1 time daily a little over one month ago. As a nurse I was very reluctant to start this medication beacuse of the possible side effects. He has some dryness of his lips (Carmex has worked well)some low back discomfort (Tylenol,Ibuprofen) He just started complaining of some itchy skin (Sarna lotion) After the first 3 weeks I noticed improvement in the redness of his face and no new whiteheads.Overall we feel it has been worth the minor side effects', 'I am a 34 year old hispanic female the started getting cysitc acne about 4-5 years ago I started claravis 12 days ago 40 mg once a day.

I have no energy, I don't want to get out of bed, and I just feel sleepy all the time.  This has just started in the last week, but I have to get back to work and my normal life. My face looks good for just being on it 2 months, but i'll take my chances of the acne coming back.\", \"I have been taking 40mg of Claravis, once a day, for 27 days.  After about 1 wk my lips began to chap and dry out, and the sides of my mouth tend to crack if I don't moisturize.  My acne did get worse around 18 days in, so my dr. put me on prednisone to lessen the reaction.  And on week 3 I noticed my left knee joint starting to hurt (I exercise and run regularly and hear that that side effect is common for people who regularly exercise).  I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing anything similar, and if the joint pain will go away after medication is completed?  Just today (day 27) I noticed a rash on the back of my left hand! I hope the results are worth the side effects!\", 'This has been my first week on this drug. I have got to say I had to go through a lot to just get the prescription. It is not hard to manage taking the meds. I am hopeful this is going to work. So far just dry skin. I am noticing a change in the texture and consistency of my outer layer of facial skin. ', \"Very frustrated. I'm on my 2nd round of  Claravis.  1st round I took for 3.5 months & my acne got worse throughout and after 3.5 months I\\ndecided to stop due to the side effects. I contacted shingles shortly after discontining it this strong medicine.  It weakened my immune sys. terribly and I feel this is why I got Shingles which was 7-8 weeks painful hell.   My acne slowed only for a short time and came back full blown. Dr said I must not have taken it long enough. So we tried it all over again after several more months.  So far I am in month 4 and this medicine has not cured me yet.  I am worried it will never work.  My face is already severely scared and my social interaction has almost stopped. I am so ashamed of the scaring on my face.  I cannot afford fancy laser treatments to help this  condition plus I am not cured yet.  I still have severe acne and it is always there.  When one leaves a new one developes.  I have 10-20 bad spots every day.  I hate going to work and having to go to lunch with folks.  I am very distant because of it.  I will not go out with friends and don't ever ever let anyone see me without make up .  I do a lot of hiding on weekends.  I am not sure I am not one of those people this does not work on.  It is grueling on one's body and personality as well but I pray it will work soon.  Even though my scars are permanent I would just give anything if the acne would go away.  I don't look like anyone else I know and it is difficult to deal with.\", 'I am also on my 2nd treatment.  The benefits do go away after approx 10 years.  I have been on 60 mg/day (avg-80 one day & 40 the next)for a week.  I have had very dry lips and pressure headaches almost daily.  It is worth it in the end because of the psychological effects of nodular acne.  I would not recommend this for teens though because they have less emotional stability and/or self awareness on how to deal with mood swings.', \"This is my 2nd experience w/ this medication. I did Accutane 10 years ago as a senior in high school, but I was never fully cured. After having 2 babies & trying everything on the market, it came time to give Accutane (Claravis) another shot. I'm now nearing the end of month 2 (month 1=40 mg 1/day, now I'm on 40 mg 2x/day), and I'm starting to notice remarkable change - I'm not fully clear yet, but the pimples that do pop up are not as painful or widespread as before. My skin is less oily, which seemed to just make everything worse to begin with! I've had some minor side effects but they feel completely manageable to me - dry lips (Aquafor or any kind of lip balm), dry eyes (I typically avoid my contacts), mild headaches...that's about it. I had a day or two where a red rash popped up on my hands, but cortisone cleared it up and I haven't seen it sense. My largest complaint is the iPledge program - I completely understand the importance of it, but it's not user friendly at all! Otherwise, so far, the side effects have been mild, and are completely worth the improvement in my skin so far. I can't wait until it's completely clear and I start looking like a 27 year old mother rather than a 12 year old!\", \"this medication is the best thing that's ever happened to me.\", \"135 lbs, male here. Started 20mg/day on first month. 40mg/day 2nd month. Minor and manageable rashes up to this point. On third month, it was upped to 60mg/day. But after two days of taking it, my rashes got out of control. It's all over my arms, elbows and spreading on my neck. Back and muscle pains are also starting to be noticable. At this time, I would prefer having acne than what I have now. I'm far in far worse shape now. Satisfaction is 1 out of 5 right now. It can go up to 3 out of 5 (at best), assuming these side effects disappear and that they're not permanent!\", 'I am 27 and have been dealing with adult acne since college.

This has worked!!!!  It has been BRUTAL to my skin, though.  I AM SUPER OILY and this dried me out so bad I blistered and peeled, had a fever blister outbreak all over my face, etc.  BUT IT HAS BEEN WORTH IT.  I had to stop taking for a few days to let my skin calm down by direction of my doc.  He said it is an accumulation in the body that constitutes it effectiveness...

I have found that Abreva and Dr. Dan's Corti Balm works great for the mouth area.

I can look at people in the eye now and have a conversation without feeling self conscious, its a great feeling.  I highly reccomnend this drug for someone who is dealing with this problem.  Also the side effects for me have been minimal.  I'm thinking that since my skin was so oily that maybe thats why I never got the dry mouth or eyes I don't know.

I had to wait about 3 months before I starting seeing results the first time. This time I saw results within weeks. This also means the side effects have been more immediate (dry lips and inside of nose), however my side effects were manageable both times. Mainly it's just extremely dry lips that sting and turn red, and some minor irritation/nose bleed in my nose. Otherwise I don't have any other bad side effects. I use sunscreen daily.

    "medical_condition_description":"Acne Other names: Acne Vulgaris; Blackheads; Breakouts; Cystic acne; Pimples; Whiteheads; Zits Acne is a skin condition caused by dead skin cells sticking together and clogging up pores. Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from acne worse than others. Bad acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skin’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your acne. It is a myth that you have to let acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin. See a dermatologist if you feel shy or products don't work.",

It is my miracle drug. I take it for d. h. Wheever a case flares up i can always count on this drug.  My mr. itchies have moved around my body in regards to where the symptoms begin to show up.  in the beginning they would always start on my butt cheeks and groin area. Then they moved to starting up on my earlobes. They have always, even today been most severe on and behind my knees and on my elbows and under forearm. Presently they tend to start on the tops of my feet.  I don't know where I would be without this drug.  Probably in a mental hospital.\", \"I have had Dermetitis Herpetiformis for the past 30 years.  I had it about 25 years ago all over my body (except face, neck and hands)I was covered everywhere else.  I was like that for over a year and that is when I received my diagnois and starting taking Dapsone.  Within a month I starting clearing up and he went away for 20 years.  It has started to come back (not quite as bad as 20 years ago) but I am seeing spot break out on leg and arms.  I am back on Dapsone but it is just holding its own.  I can't quite get rid of it but it livable.  \", 'The drug sent my body into a lupus flare up.  I was in bed with fever & constant body aches until I stopped taking the drug.', 'I was diagnosed with dH about 5 years ago, prob had it much longer without knowing. Dapsone worked great, relieved itching in 24 hrs. Now take 100mg every 4 to 5 days and this avoids major flare ups though I still get itchy and uncomfortable feeling if I take any gluten foods. I try to be gluten free but that is almost impossible to achieve,\\nVery concerned to read that Dapsone may not be available - would not know what to do if I could not get it, itching is intolerable! I often get dizzy, short of breath and feeling \"unwell\" but this is better than the itch! I also have blood tests at least annually, so far all is well.', \"dermatitis herpetiformis is what the Dermatoligist said I have caused by celiac. Of course I have had the biopsy, blood work, light down the throat so they could biopsy stomach all said celiac. Don't understand how one becomes allergiac to wheat after 50 yrs. Oh well I have taken Dapsone 100 mg for 5 yrs & I thought it was a wonder drug. I have celiac and am in the 20% that get the blisters (elbows,legs,but checks,& eyelids). Now I have been told I have medically induced Lupus which has caused a lung disease because of this drug. I was taken off Dapsone & the blisters came back within 2 days. Started a new drug Sulfasalazine 1000mg twice daily. Just started so don't know if it's going to help will let you know. It will take a long time for the blisters to heal (diabetic also) & I hate the scars they leave. The lung Dr. want do another cat scan for lungs till November as Dr. says I have to be off Dapsone 3 mths to see if it is Dapsone causing the problem but according to them Family Dr. & Lung Specialist it's the only drug I take that can cause the problem. I have checked for this side effect but so far nothing. Help if anybody has went through this as I am a little scared. I now have to sleep wiyh oxygen & use oxygen when I am doing anything as oxygen level drops to low. I am only 53.\", \"I have been using dapsone for 7 years for dermatitis herpetiformis. I've had celiac disease for over 20 years and suffered with this rash for 13 years before my doctor would send me to a dermatologist (she was concerned about the anemia it can cause.)It has been a miracle drug for me. I started out at 100mg/day. I took it for 11 days and then broke out into a peppery body rash. I was told by my pharmacist to stop using it until the dh rash appeared again (it took about 4 days). I take on average 3 pills/week. This keeps it under control. Unfortunately following the gluten free diet does not cure the rash no matter how strict I am. The dermatologist says this happens to a small percentage of celiacs. I was recently diagnosed with vitamin B12 deficiency and now take monthly shots. I had started taking synthroid for thyroid issues and this seemed to make the dapsone less effective even though I took them a few hours apart. This made me need the dapsone more often and the peppery rash came back very badly.I stopped taking the synthroid and am back to needing the dapsone only 3 times/week.My doctor will probably not be happy with me but I'd rater go without synthroid than discontinue the dapsone. I think I would go out of my mind with the itching and blistering. Has anyone else had adverse reactions with synthroid and dapsone? \", \"My dr. prescribed dapsone as a last result. For that last 3 years I've had a skin disorder no one could diagnois.On my fore arms and lower legs nodules appeared raised and then darken due to the intense itching. It's been biopsied, uvb light treated, creams and ointments galore....nothing worked.  I've been taking dapsone for 3 months.  My legs have cleared 90% and my arms 50%.  I am very happy and will contiune this med until all is clear.\", \"This medication is my miracle drug, as many have probably said before me. I got my DH diagnosis about 5 years after it first appeared. I only had adverse effects in the first few weeks, which included change of sleeping patterns, loss of appetite, muscle weakness and irritability. But after the first few weeks everything was just fine, have been taking it with no problems since then. But recently my health insurance lapsed, and my Dermatologist refused to refill without doing my labs, which is understandable, but ever since I ran out of the medicine I've been having some very strange side-effects, including blood blisters in every finger and toe, all over my palms, blisters larger than grapes that just never stop burning, pins and needles in the affected areas. Constant nausea, no matter what I eat, extreme fatigue. \\nI ended up going to the ER because it was hurting so bad that I could hardly move, they did my labs, and now I just have to wait for my meds to come in, (have to order them every time I need a refill). \\nBut my question is whether anyone else has ever had side-effects similar to mine when abruptly stopping the medication? \", 'I have been taking dapsone for 1 and 1/2 years now for d.h. It has worked remarkably well for me with no side effects.', \"I was diagnosed with Wells Syndrome a few months ago and my Dermatologist put me on Dapsone.  I take 50mg/day adn after 30 days, I stopped getting lesions.  My Dr. said I could try taking 25 mg/day.... after the 4th day I got a new lesion! so I'm back to 50 mg/day.  I am a runner, and now that I've been on it for over 2 months I think it is begining to affect my lungs.  I NEVER had problems breathing when I run.  Today I thought I was going to have to call an ambulance for oxygen... no joke.  Think it's from the dapsone?\", 'I was diagnosed with Dermatitis Herpetiformis in 1979.I was covered head to toe in burning blisters. After starting on Dapsone & a Sulfa cream, my condition cleared very rapidly. I have had no side effects. My doctor keeps aclose eye on all my labs. Some mild anemia which he thinks may be the Dapsone. I continue to take 100 mg daily. Change in diet did very little. Only problem is pharmacey had to track down a manufacturer. They were only able to find one.', 'My blisters were gone, but the packaging is very difficult.  Called the Co. 2x but this year they are very hard to open.

I suffer a drug induced Hyposensitivity with the two.\", 'Diagnosed with Dermatitis Herpetiformis in about 1968. Initial dose 200mg per day .  Very effective at clearing skin blisters but severe headaches associated with the medication.  Went on gluten free diet in about 1970.  Reduced dosage to nil over 8 years.  Now have to take Dapsone occasionally even though very strict with diet.

It would wake me up at 2am every night and I could not top itching. After 2 years of diagnosis a Doctor figured out I had Dermititus Herpetiformis by taking a biopsy of some of the blisters. He prescriped Dapsone. It cleared up the itching within 24 hours but made me extremely tired and light headed. I went for an upper GI to confirm if I had Celiac Disease and discovered that my oxygen levels were at 80% versus 95 to 96%. I turned blue in when getting the upper GI. The doctor said that Dapsone takes oxygen out of your blood and recommended I stop taking it. I have been on a strict Gluten free diet for two weeks (the itching has come back but is getting less severe).', 'I was on a high dose of prednizone to combat bullous pemphigoid, which I\\'d had for several years before it was definitively diagnosed through a pathological exam, and as my doc reduced the prednizone, the blisters returned more in both quantity and frequency--not as bad as with no medication, but still not neat--and staying on high doses of prednizone just wasn\\'t acceptable (too many side effects). \\n\\nI started on a low (25mg) dose of Dapsone and gradually that was increased to the current 100mg/day, and I am now off of prednizone altogether.

However, I seemed to have developed an anxiety problem over the last year that doesn't appear to be connected with any personal problems.  Anxiety isn't listed as a side effect in the paperwork that comes with Dapsone, although I have seen it mentioned a few places on line.  I came to this site to see if anyone else mentioned anxiety related to this medication and so far  I have not seen it mentioned.

    "medical_condition":"Acne",
    "medical_condition_description":"Acne Other names: Acne Vulgaris; Blackheads; Breakouts; Cystic acne; Pimples; Whiteheads; Zits Acne is a skin condition caused by dead skin cells sticking together and clogging up pores. Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from acne worse than others. Bad acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skin’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your acne. It is a myth that you have to let acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin. See a dermatologist if you feel shy or products don't work.",

    "Reviews":"[\"My experience with this birth control has been satisfactory, overall. The reason I gave it 4/5 is because in an ideal world, there would be no side effects or very minor side effects. Clearly, that is not entirely realistic, but if I were to give it 5/5, it would need to be this way. I decided to post a positive review, because most of the ones you see on here are negative, so this is to reassure people who may be looking to try this that not everyone has a bad experience with it.\\nThe side effects I experienced were mood swings throughout and nausea on the first day or two of taking it, with a few instances of vomiting. I was able to overcome both of these, for the most part, though. The mood swings got better after I had taken it for a few months. Also, once I figured out that my pill was the cause of my mood swings, they became easier to control.\\nWith the nausea and vomiting, I discovered in the third month that if I eat right before I take the first pill of a new pack and continue to keep food in my stomach after taking it (I take it at 6:30pm every day), then the nausea I had previously experienced would either be very minimal or gone entirely. I experienced this nausea about 5 hours after, sometimes sooner, but sometimes I would wake up with it about 10 hours later and vomit if I couldn't get it to pass. Like I said, I only  experienced this with the first pill of a new pack, and it was much better or nonexistent when I took it with food. I have a sensitive stomach, so that is a large reason why I experienced the nausea and vomiting in the first place. On a side note, I went from a 34B to a 34C on this pill. Of course, everyone has different experiences, but that was a nice side effect that I had! My acne is also better. My cramps are MUCH better. I had horrible ones before this that made me throw up and black out. Shorter periods.\\nI 20 years old, and I have been on Ocella for around a year and a half. I hope this helps someone out there!\", \"Ocella is just the same as Yasmin. I have had NO difference in side effects since switching. It's been about 2 months now and I was on Yasmin for over 2 years. Ocella (just like Yasmin) makes my skin perfect and made my chest bigger--which I won't complain about! It also makes my periods very regular (Weds-Sun) with NO cramping or any other sign than the obvious. Please don't let people's horror stories sway you, this pill is the same thing!! \", \"Have no side effects still after using ocella for 3 yeas. Makes my breasts larger, period lasts 4 days, no zits, no cramps/period-like symptoms, and not a pregnancy scare even once. Boyfriend and I don't use protection, we are in a stable realtionship. Love this. Sucks that all of you have had these bad experiences...I couldn't Imagine. It's true when i say that eceryone reacts to drugs differently than others. Just have to work a little harder to find the right one. Good luck ladies!!!!\", \"I have had nothing but horrible experiences with BC! I started taking Yaz 3 years ago, I had to switch after 5 months because of the ridiculous cost. Since then I have been on 7 different birth controls... Loestrin, Levoa, Lessina, ortho tri cyclen, etc. NONE of them worked. I had break through bleeding (and I mean bleeding 20 days out of the month) with all but Lessina, but that one caused me to gain 15 pounds and I had some horrible mood swings. I was out of hope and gave up on BC a few months ago, but I went to a new doctor and she said I should try Ocella since it was similar to Yaz (the only BC that worked for me)Ive been on it for a couple months and so far it's great! I've already lost 5 pounds, my skin looks great, no break through bleeding, and short periods.  For me this is great! BUT i highly recommend that women shouldn't focus so much on these reviews. From my BC experiences I've learned the best way to go about BC is trial and error.  EVERYONE'S body is different, and everyone reacts different to each pill.  \", \"I've been on Ocella for about 3 months.  And, since being switched from Yazmin to Ocella, I've had extreme soreness in my breasts, bloating, increased appetite, nauseous, and have been tired a lot.  I figured it was the pills because I didn't have any of these problems when I was on Yazmin.  I was scared for a moment because I thought I was pregnant.  But, when I did some research on Ocella, I found that a lot of people were experiencing some of the same problems I have been having.  So that is a hugh weight lifted off my shoulders.  Thank God I go to the doctor tomorrow and I will definitely requested to be switched back to Yazmine, no matter how much it costs!\", \"I was so glad they finally made a generic for Yasmin. I've been taking it for about eight years and I switched to Ocella as soon as it came out. I have not noticed any difference whatsoever and it's effective and easy to use. I recommend it.\", \"I switched to Ocella from Yasmin a couple of months ago to save money.  I have had the worst experience with Ocella.  My breasts have been really sore and I am bloated all the time! I thought I was the only one having problems.  I am switching back to Yasmin.  I hope it hasn't done any other damage to my body!!!\", \"I just wanted to throw my two cents in here about my time on Ocella, since there's so many bad reviews. I happen to be someone who had a WONDERFUL experience with Ocella. I went on this pill when I was 18 and just starting birth control. It took a few tries to find the right one, and this was it for me. I had virtually no side effects (except for slightly more tender breasts ONLY during my period). Also, I had AMAZING skin. With the affordable health care changes, my insurance ended up no longer covering this pill... I was originally paying 10$/3 months. Now I can only do 1 month at time and there's a deductible I have to reach before my insurance will cover it for 8$/mo. Decently big spike from before. I have been on/off a few different pills since this happened last summer and none of them have worked as well as Ocella... so don't be scared of this pill, everyone reacts differently and people usually only review their bads experiences anyway!\", 'When I started my first pack I get a yeast infection. Also...I feel crazy, very irritable and anxious.', 'My insurance switched me from Yasmin to Ocella. I take other generics so never thought twice about the change. I took Yasmin for 4 years and Ocella for 4 months and had to get off of it. I had to give myself time to adjust, I shouldn\\'t have! \\n\\nI couldn\\'t handle life anymore. I was depressed, had a very short fuse and constantly felt uncomfortable in my body. I started having issues sleeping, I would sleep only about 4 hrs a night but would sleep about 30 hrs on the weekends. Never more than 4 hrs at a time. Whenever I was awake I was \"munchy\" and everytime I would eat something I would pass out cold without warning. \\n\\nMy periods were horrible, I cramped for 4 days and my actual period was 7 days long, on Yasmin my period started Wed and ended Fri. \\n\\nI have since changed to a new birth control and within the first week I noticed a huge difference. I am actually happy and motivated to life life again. My period is now only 2 days and no cramps or depression. I never knew how bad it was until I changed to something that really works for me.', \"I switched to this because it was cheaper. Oh my Lord, I can't believe howmany women outthere have experienced the same side affects that I have! The bloating, the breast soreness, the not sleeping, the tiredness, the feeling of being pregnant! Why is this drug still available? I am switching back to my Yasmine and I seriously worn other woman about trying this just because it's cheaper. Stick with what you know, Yasmine. \", \"I first started BC pills with Ocella & I took them for 3 years. When I first started I had common side effects like: nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, but my body effectively adjusted after 3 months. I loved that it cleared out my horrible acne. I never had any of those other side effects like weight gain, etc. When I rarely missed a pill & took 2 the following day it was a wild card, sometimes I felt nauseous. 2 1/2 years later in taking these pills I randomly get pinching pain on my legs and thighs. A few noticeable veins will randomly swell and pinch, since then I have stopped taking these pills. I am sure my body naturally wouldn't produce these effects at such a young age (22) and with no family history of blood clots, I am very suspicious of the quality of these pills. These adverse effects may or may not happen to you, but I must say pay close attention to your body before & after giving yourself time to adjust to any BC pill and do inform yourself as Yaz, Yasmin and the generic form Ocella have been recalled. They also have a different active ingredient that questionably can lead to higher risks of blood clots than other BC pills. Overall, I don’t recommend these pills.\", 'I was switched to Ocella about 4 months ago. I noticed that my cycle got longer, and my cramps got way worse. It had gotten to the point to where my period was no longer lining up with the \"placebo\" week of the will. I actually had an appointment with my doctor to switch pills, but guess what? Yesterday I found out that I\\'m pregnant. I take the pill around the same time every single day. Not. Good.', 'Horrible mood swings, headaches, crying spells, acne--within 1 week of switching to Ocella from Triphasil.  MD advised to finish the month, but I will not take this medication again.  ', 'I was put on ocella after I had my first baby and I hate it I am always in a bad mood it makes my horomones crazy and my breast are so tender and I think I now have a lump in one of them... I would stay with yasmin and pay more!', \"I switched to this from Yasmin, and I am anything but happy with it.  I'm much more irritable, I have more acne, and to everyone else it seems like I have more PMS.  I also suffer from cramps for the first time while on birth control.  I'm gonna see if I can go back to Yasmin.  2 Months of this is 2 months too much.\", \"My doctor recommended that I switch to Ocella when I complained that Loestrin made me overemotional.  She explained that Ocella was cheaper than Yasmin and that it was essentially the same thing.  I cannot emphasize enough how much I disagree.\\n\\nWhen I was taking Ocella, I was always exhausted and felt completely drained and exhausted.  I had terrible sharp, pounding headaches.  I constantly felt nauseous and had no appetite.  In the last days I took Ocella, the only way I could make it through the day was to take Tylenol every few hours.  All of this is uncharacteristic of me, as I am 19 years old and in good health.  I have never experienced anything like this before I took Ocella.  The Ocella did alleviate the moodiness caused by Loestrin, but only because I was too exhausted to really feel anything.  I felt like a zombie.\\n\\nI switched to Yasmin, and this is only my third day taking it and I feel 110% better.  \\n\\nI've been reading up about Yasmin and Ocella, and from what I understand there are a few major differences.  Apparently, the active ingredients are the same, but the inactive ingredients and coating on the pill, etc, are different.  Anyone is welcome to validate this, but I could believe it considering the complete 180 I experienced after switching to Yasmin.\\n\\nIn summary, taking Ocella is probably one of the worst decisions you could ever make.\", \"I am on month 3 and it will be my last.  I will go back to using Yasmin!  I don't care if I have to pay more.  I have been depressed, irritable, and tense.  My acne has been awful and my breasts are sore and swelling like when I was pregnant.  Just awful!  The only time I feel good is when I am on the non-hormone white pill for the one week.  I have also been feeling ill and keep getting colds, sore throat and congestion that seems to start once I start a new pack each month.  I don't know if it's related but I have been no where near 100% since starting this pill.  Not good when trying to keep up with three little boys!\", \"I've used BC approximately 24 years.  I used Triphasal-28 for years.  Dr. switched me to Yasmin afer having kids.  Yasmin worked fine - nothing special.  After being switched from Yasmin to Ocella (by my pharmacy) over a year ago, my body has slowly fallen apart.  Unexplained weight gain and bloating, severe gastro issues - digestive/constipation, dizziness, hair loss, the skin on my face constantly pealed, trouble wearing my contact lenses, inability to sleep, shortness of breath, rapid heart beat, severe migranes every month that could last for 3 days, anxiety/bad mood, no energy, barely any period at all, severe lower back pain, my bones and joints would ache without reason to the point that moving was painful.  I thought I was experiencing early menopause and severe osteoprosis.  I couldn't function without ibuprofen - which the info packet says you're not supposed to take while on Ocella.  Dr.'s tests couldn't find a cause for any of this.  So I quit taking Ocella.  After being pill-free for the last 3 weeks, nearly all of these symptoms are gone.  It's amazing - I feel great.  No more pain, no headaches, I have lost weight, sleeping well again, and my energy level is back.  I'm so glad to have my life back on track.  Ocella should be banned. \", \"I was switched for Yasmin to Ocella (without notice) by my pharmacy. The pharmacist told that it was the just generic Yasmin but assured me it was same medication.  It's NOT. I was on Yasmin for 3 years with ZERO problems. In fact, it was great. While on Yasmin my skin was clear (I got compliments on it), my period lasted 3-4 days, and I wasn't moody.  However after being on Ocella for 3 months my life has changed. I am no longer the happy healthy 22 year old I was before. I have become depressed and withdrawn from family and friends. My skin broke out like CRAZY which it's never done before. I am having shortness of breathing and anxiety.  I work for a holistic health doctor so I know a good deal about alternative health care and I am conscious about changes in my body. I am kicking myself for not stopping this pill sooner. I am done with this pill now, switched back to Yasmin 3 days ago. I cannot wait to feel like myself again. Ocella should be banned. \", 'I was on Yazmin for 2 years with no problems. When my insurance stopped covering it my pharmacy switched me over to ocella, they said \"it\\'s the exat same thing\". Well they were wrong!!! I told my mom and boyfriend that i\\'m switching pills and to let me know if they notice a change. Within 3 weeks I was an emotional basket case....everything was making me upset and I was crying daily over everything from commercials to stupid comments that offended me for no reason.  Both my mom and boyfriend had interventions with me saying this pill was making me really difficult to deal with. But I was so unreasonable I refused to get off of it (\"no, it\\'s not the pill i\\'m just stressed at work, leave me alone!\"). Everyone is different, so you don\\'t know until you try it, but the reviews on this pill are pretty uniformly bad so I don\\'t think it\\'s worth it!!!', \"this is the only bc i have every tried and it is amazing, some how the first week I started to take it I lost 7lbs not doing ANY thing different in my diet or exercise regime (probably in water but still- I'm not even a big person), yet also in this miracle week I went up one cup size for the first time since seventh grade. Oh and I'm not pregnant... Best thing I've ever put in my body.\", \"For the last 2 years I have been taking Ocella and I have been sick for about 14 months now. I never linked this to my birth control but after hearing about the lawsuits I looked into it more. I have had nausea, dizziness/vertigo, chest pains, shortness of breath, have gained about 15 pounds in the last year after being the same weight for my entire life, hot flashes, depression, general weakness and fatigue, some muscle pains and spasms in my leg, and absolutely NO sex drive. My boyfriend hates it and thinks I hate him because I am always screaming at him for no reason. I have had an MRI, CT scan, EKG, did a treadmill test for my heart, inner ear tests (for balance), blood work, eyes checked, tested for mono, x-rays on everything etc...and every single specialist said nothing was wrong with me and it was all in my head! So I tried yoga, eating differently, even therapy to reduce stress!! I still feel like crap and sometimes cannot work because I can't walk straight from being dizzy. I do not recommend anyone take this pill when there are better options. I am seeing my obgyn tomorrow to find a new method or just stop the pills altogether and use condoms. Finally after more than a year I feel like this might be the answer to my problems. DO NOT take this pill, it should be off the market!\", \"I just stopped taking ocella after a year of taking it. At first it was great it helped my moods, I no longer got UTI's which was my issue with my previous pill, my periods were lighter and shorter than ever and I was very pleased. The last 5 months I started being very tired, no sex drive (almost disgusted with the thought of it), while having sex the inability to make discharge (if so it was very thick and uncomfortable), constant yeast infections almost like an underlying constant small amount of yeast that made me itchy and uncomfortable, irritable mood, yelling, crying, mood swings all this was so bad that my fiance considered leaving me saying that I was not the girl I used to be. I stopped taking it and I have none of these issues and it happened immediately after I stopped and my fiance started calling me wife again. lol. DO NOT USE THIS BC, there are so many issues and side affects including death do your research! I have decided to use condoms I no longer want to alter my body.\", \"I switched from Yasmin to Ocella 4 month ago because of it's price.It works great for me.I used to have headaches on Yasmin during  sugar peel week and I don't any more, my periods are day shorter and with less cramps.I do not have any side-effects other than extra cash in my pocket. \", 'I was involuntarily put on Ocella when the generic came out. I originally was on Yasmin with no problems whatsoever. One week into my first Ocella dose, I was paralyzed by the worst stream of migraines that I have ever experienced. Along with the migraines came nausea and vision impairment. NOT a happy user!!!', \"I am another unhappy user, and find great relief to read that other women have experienced similar problems with this pill. I switched from Yasmin to Ocella when it went generic a few months ago. I felt funny after the first month, but the pharmacist assured me that Ocella is exactly the same as Yasmin, so I continued and didn't reflect much more on that until now, when side effects have gotten out of control. I've gradually become more and more irritable, weird mood swings, problems sleeping, fatigue, cramps and aches that I never had before, and trouble focusing. Worst of all, I've gotten anxious and extremely sensitive as if I were made of glass. I get upset and angry for small things, and cry almost every day for no particular reason. It seems the pill can explain much of this. Needless to say, I'm switching back to Yasmin asap.\", 'WOW...I thought I was the only who thought she was pregnant while taking this medication!! Horrible naseau...bad enough to miss work..headaches, mood swings AND acne!! I have been to the GI about 3 times to try to figure out my stomach issues...I stopped using Ocella...and I was fine!!', \"I was so scared to take this because of all the horrible things I'd read online. I've only been on this for about a week. but so far so good. I switched from ortho tri-cyclin because my skin has been pretty bad the last 6 months or so. My skin looks much better already, I've been eating less than usually and I haven't had any mood swings or anything. The only thing is i've felt a little bit more tired than usual but it's only been a week so that could be anything not necessarily from the birth control. I will keep updating if anything changes though. If you're switching from yaz or yasmin to ocella I wouldn't do it. But if you're just trying a new birth control or starting for the first time. I would recommend it, you may have good results, you may not but if it's really bad you can always get prescribed something else!! \", 'I started using birth control when I was 14 cause of problems I was having with horrible cramps. I was put on Yaz and loved it. I had no side effects whatsoever. After me and my boyfriend broke up, I wasnt having sex so I stopped using the Yaz. Last summer I started to get unbearable cramps again and went to my Gyno to get put back on birth control and she put me on Ocella.  About 1 month or so later, I started getting emotional about nothing, I started gaining weight when I was really active and working out and my depression went through the roof. The worst thing that happened was my face. In my 21 years, I have never had a problem with pimples or acne. Well I started breaking out all over my face and back with large, sore cystic zits. I finally went to a doctor to see what she could do for my face and she asked me when this started happening and then she linked all my other things that were going on to when I was put on Ocella.  Im supposed to refill in 2 weeks and didnt want to so I can be put on a different type of birth control, but lucky me my doctor cant see me for 2 months.

I would recommend Ocella.\", \"In general no bad side effects. Initially some spotting, went away after about three weeks. Regular periods afterwards, no skin problems, no weight again (although I went up a cup size during the first month).  It has now been two years and I am satisfied, although I do cry sometimes the week before my period - not sure if that's because of Ocella.\", \"Ocella is a great birth control pill, because it tanks your libido to the point that sex is  a lot less interesting to you while on it than before. Orgasms while on Ocella were hard if not impossible to reach. I personally gave up even trying to orgasm when having sex with men. I was quite thirsty while on Ocella. My appetite was voracious. I gained 2 lbs in 3 weeks. That is a lot for me because my metabolism is quite fast. Oh, and you better believe I enjoyed those massive headaches I had while on this. I had them at least a couple of times. Normally I don't really have headaches at all. Did I forget to mention how nice it felt to feel bloated? Another beautiful side effect. And another thing: Get yourself a family bottle of lubricant for 'sexy time', because you will be quite dry while on Ocella, even when you are turned on. Spotting happened every day for the first three weeks. It also looked like I am on the way to developing my first (of many, if I go on) yeast infection. All these wonderful facts together make me say: Thank you SO much, Ocella, but I had enough of you after 3 weeks! No more Ocella for me. \", \"Have felt generally sad, even though nothing else has changed in my life...so it has to be Ocella. Have found myself randomly crying everyday at little things that normally wouldn't phase me...must be the hormones.

My skin broke out for the first three months and it is now super clear! I felt like I wanted to kill someone once or twice when I first started but I have not had mood swings after that. I have also lost the 10 pounds that I gained while on another birth control pill.  I think there is a diuretic in the pill as I had to pee a lot while my body was adjusting to the pill but I was able to train myself to not go as much.  \\nI would advise those that are having adverse reactions to Ocella in the first month or so is to stick with it!

I no longer had cramps, bloating, fatigue, acne and my period was very regular. It was amazing. When I switched to Ocella I started having migraines, which I never had a migraine before. I started getting them 2-3 times a month and they were so bad that I was having to call off work. Sometimes they even lasted 3-4 days. They were always accompanied with Nausea and vomiting as well. It was horrible. I don't know if the birth control caused anxiety and depression or if it was the migraines and nausea and the effect it was having on my life, but I was very anxious and very tired and began getting very sad. One migraine was so bad I ended up in the hospital and had a CT scan, Urinalysis, and blood work and the doctor told me that he was pretty sure it was from my birth control negatively affecting my hormones.

I didn't realize that my weight gain, mild depression, loss of libido (sex drive), and anxiety could all be from one pill!

Thankfully, I am now going on Mirena.\", \"I took Ocella for about 4 months before switching to a different brand. \\nWhile taking it, not only was my skin BEAUTIFULLY clear, with not a single breakout or blemish (even if I skipped washing my face/removing my makeup), but I also went up nearly TWO cup sizes!

I was also bloated (I never experienced bloating before taking this pill) buttt I cannot 100% blame it on this pill- it could be a number of factors. This pill has a diuretic in it, so the fact that I was bloated at all is strange.\\nBesides the weird dizziness, the reason I switched to a different brand of pills was because my insurance requires me to pay full price up-front for prescriptions and then wait for the refund in the mail. Although I did get the money back eventually, shoveling out $50 a month being a college student and all was not too convenient. And of course, seeing all the commercials on tv for Yaz/Yasmin/Ocella lawsuits finally got to me!\", 'Effective birth control, cleared up my skin, no weight gain or bad side effects.

Growing up, I never had any acne other than maybe 1 pimple from time to time. When I started taking Tri-Sprintec, my face started producing more oil and I got acne on my chin and forehead. My doctor switched me to Ocella because she said it is better for acne. It has only been 5 days, but I have already seen a change in my skin and the acne is clearing up. I'm happy about that, but I also have a headache that won't go away and I have also had cramps at random times of the day. I am going to continue to take this and see how it goes.\", 'I\\'m on my 2nd pack of Ocella.  Haven\\'t been on bc since I got prego and had my son in 2008.  I was on Yasmin prior to that and had no side effects that I can remember.  First week of Ocella pills was hell.  Then I researched like hel! and found out that bc seriously depletes the vitamins in your body so I\\'m taking insane amounts of Vit C, magnesium and certain Vit B complex (look at thepillpill.com website for ideas on what vitamins to take, their pills were too expensive so I looked at their label and made my own \"pill cocktail\" purchasing local).  Since I\\'ve been taking vitamins EVERYTHING is almost back to normal!  These vitamins will help improve circulation (i.e. lessen risk for blood clots), no more headaches, etc.  My acne has also DRASTICALLY improved, my boobs are HUGE (34B to 34 big C) and my sex drive is rediculously good.  One complaint?  At 5\\'4\" 112lbs I\\'m now 118lbs in less than 2 months.  That\\'s a weight gain of 6lbs.  I\\'m FREAKED OUT because I have not done ANYTHING different and I\\'m REALLY CONCERNED about any further weight gain.  If I gain any more (other than in my boobs :) I\\'m coming off this pill.

I have had severe mood swings including unhappiness and anger, facial issues with skin and acne and an increase in vagainal secretions.  This is defintly not made for me.

I experienced a lot of the normal BCP changes when you switch brands, mood swings, bloating, fatigue, etc in the first couple of months. However two side effects that I developed after 6 months use have been a major issue. First, I developed a breast lump, palpable, did not show on any scans, so had surgery to remove it in Feb\\'09. It was an over growth of breast tissue, caused by, guess what, HOROMONES from birth control. Second issue, Recurrent stubborn yeast infections. I have had a recurring yeast infection since December 08. One week before period I get a yeast infection. If it doesn\\'t \"go away\" with the medicine and period, it comes right back within two days of me starting the pill pack again. Again, this is caused by hormonal changes. Thankfully I go to see the obgyn next month and will be talking to her about coming off bcp completely to get preggers. One good point is that my skin has never been so clear in my life. But other than that I will be so glad to get off this pill!!! ', 'I switched to Ocella because my pharmacist told me it was the new generic for Yasmin. I was very excited at first, but then I started piecing all my new symptoms together, and I can\\'t wait to return to Yasmin next week. I believe I took Ocella for the previous 2-3 months and over that time have experienced a persistent \"heaviness\" in my low stomach area, terrible cramps even when I wasn\\'t on my period, my skin began \"acting up\", I was nauseated and even found myself throwing up at random times through out the day. I thought for a bit that I might even be pregnant. This wasn\\'t the case, and I truly feel like the \"little things\" that have been a such a big deal to me over the past several months can be attributed entirely to the Ocella. I have been taking Yasmin since 2003 when it first came out, and never once have I experienced any of these side effects, not to mention the \"break-through\" bleeding. Knowing what I know now, I would never recommend this generic to anyone. I would urge those considering the change due to the difference in cost to seriously consider whether it is worth it. I know that prices vary across the country, but here it is only a 10-15$ difference (I don\\'t have health insurance currently). For me, the extra cost is worth every penny. ', 'WORKS AS WELL AS YASMIN DID BUT CHEAPER I HAVE EXPERIENCED LIGHTER PERIODS WITH OCELLA!!!!!', 'I switched from Yasmine to Ocella a month ago, as the pharmacy asked me if it would bother me to take a generic.  I broke out in terrible hives; with welts from my eyes to my ankles.  I segregated by morning pills and found it was Ocella causing the allergic reaction.  I called the pharmacist and the gynecologist, and they both stated it was unusual as Yasmine and Ocella have the same active ingredients.  Judging by the comments contained here, I would say it is not uncommon.  I was able to remedy it by taking benedryl on my own to counter the allergic reaction...I started back on Yasmine, and everything seems to be o.k.

Now I'm just a moody, crampy, fat chic. Good luck ladies.\", 'I took Yasmin for over two years and then switched to Ocella and have yet to notice any difference between the two.

So far I have noticed that my periods are lighter with very very minimal cramping.  My skin has cleared a little but I am hopeful this will only get better after month 3.  I do get a slight headache (I RARELY get headaches) during my period, but not bad enough to even take an aspirin.  I am also on a thyroid medication since last April = Levothyroxin that I think has caused me to have anxiety. I am hoping to switch off that med soon.  Anyway, as for all the negativity about Ocella - I haven't had any problems. \", \"I HATE THIS PILL. I have had nothing but consistent problems. Not so much with weight gain, but my moods are awful, my anxiety is ridiculous, I am ALWAYS tired, and the breakthrough bleeding is virtually impossible to live with. I thought I was switched from Yasmin to Ocella by my doctor which in fact it was the pharmacy...saving me money by creating unbearable body situations. I barely have a period when I am supposed to but basically have breakthrough bleeding for two weeks out of the three I am NOT supposed to have a period. I have been taking it for 10 months because I thought that was what my doctor wrote the script for. I have been on BC for a long time (13 years) the only other time I had this happen was when I was on Depo, and even that wasn't this bad. It has impacted everything in my life. I will have cramps, but barely any bleeding when my cycle arrives, but I will bleed off and on for a week after my period, and the week before...lately the spotting has continued sporadically throughout the middle week. I can't stand this anymore. Naturally I was concerned as most of you seem, so I called and made an appointment, and my doctor's office was rather peeved that the pharmacy changed the prescription. I have considered other options such as the implant, but most of the complaints people have is the bleeding...I already have that. I would rather pay the 35 dollars to not have to suffer with the ridiculous side effects of this crappy pill.\", \"I was on Levora before switching to Ocella. I've been on Ocella for about a year and it has made my skin so clear, and I have had no weight gain like previously, but it has also made me extremely moody. I cry at the littlest things and have a shorter patience than before. Headaches are also common but I have always been privy to them, so I'm not sure if its just me or the pill. I also have extreme nausea and throw up if I miss a pill, or sometimes when I start a new pack. I feel like the benefits out weigh the bad things so I am okay with it (also not pregnant!), but if you are sensitive to nausea/mood swings I wouldn't recommend going on this pill. \", \"I had to switch to Ocella from BeYaz since my insurance did not cover it anymore. I was pretty optimistic to try Ocella, though I read countless negative reviews, I never really experience bad symptoms with birth control. I was only on BeYaz for three months (Implanon before that) and now I'm about a month and a half into Ocella. And let me just say this, my skin is great. Which is initially why I wanted to take the pill again. However, I've been experiencing SEVERE anxiety and depression and I didn't want to blame it on the birth control. But now at this point I am so certain that this has caused my anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts. I am constantly upset over everything and not even my wonderful boyfriend can cheer me up fully anymore. Absolutely switching to something with less estrogen. Great for skin and I'm still not pregnant, but it is not worth the heavy thoughts and unending sadness. \", \"The only reason I didn't rate this pill a 1, is because it did clear up my skin, which is initially why I switched to Ocella. I was on BeYaz for 3 months and loved it, and when i learned my insurance did not cover it, I quickly had to switch to a similar generic birth control. Which I thought Ocella was always compared to BeYaz. So let me just say it did wonders for my skin. HOWEVER, within a week of taking the pill, I noticed a huge change in my mood. I was really sad all of the time, especially at work. It only went down from there. After 5 weeks on Ocella, I had an anxiety attack at my boyfriends house and the following week I experienced the heaviest depression I have ever felt in my life. I had horrible thoughts, felt hopeless and down for no reason at all. I couldn't sleep or eat and was unable to work because my emotions would get the best of me. I had never been so miserable in my life, and to think it was all coming from my birth control! I immediately stopped taking the pills and called my doctor. He wanted me to switch to a new pill, Microgestin, but after my experience with Ocella I am traumatized by what could happen on the pill. I am just here to explain my time on Ocella and of course, everyone will respond differently to certain medications, however, before taking Ocella I did read a lot of reviews about the depression and moodiness component to it and didn't think anything of it. I'm glad I stopped it when I did, no one should have to feel like they aren't themselves. Honestly no birth control is worth living like a zombie. It's almost been two weeks since I've been off it and I'm slowly starting to feel like me again. Good luck ladies, hope this helps.\", \"I have been on and off of birth control since I was 15.

I can't say whether or not any issues I have any related to the pill or not. I haven't been of of it to notice a difference. However, the pill works great for me. Little to no acne, minor weight gain, but that may be from diet, and no mood swings. I was clinically depressed before taking the pill so any issues I have are from that. I was going to switch to Seasonique, but after reading the common side effects and reviews (severe acne, weight gain, depression, hair loss?!)

My skin looks flawless while on ocella, although I have had problems too. The first night I get on Ocella I always vomit uncontrollably. Since getting back on it 2-3 months ago I have had bad reactions from alcohol, and I'm really wondering if the two are related. I haven't seen any prior info on it but I vomit almost every time I drink now, and that has not ever happened prior.

I was given Ocella by the pharmacist and having never been on actual yasmin I don't know that there is a differce b/w the two. The first week everything seemed normal and then around the beginning of week 2 two I started to retain a lot of water. My mouth always felt dry, the skin on my face became dry and peeled, and as a result my water intake drastically increased. Normally drinking more water would not be a problem, however, I seem to barely ever pee. As a result I've gained about 4 pounds and I was hoping that maybe it would only be a few days. For the record I work out for at least an hour 5-6 days a week and I lead a pretty active lifestyle. I've since upped my cardio even more and the weight has increased.

Of course, the pharmacy gave me the generic version, Ocella. Within the first 2 weeks of taking it, I was nauseous and my breasts hurt. They weren't tender or sore, they flat out HURT. I actually took a pregnancy test even though I had had a normal period 2 weeks prior. I also gained a couple pounds. At first I attributed this to moving from the Midwest to Florida and not being as active since I was not working. Fast forward 2.5 months and I had gained 7 pounds!!! I have NEVER gained weight from a birth control pill before! I started doing some research online and found many reviews similar to the one I am giving.

I currently take anti-depressants, and I believe the Ocella counteracts with them. I can notice that my mood is just awful. I am irritated or in a bad mood for no reason 99% of the time. In addition, I have gained at least 5lbs and am constantly hungry. I attribute this to the Ocella as well, since my anti-depressant actually curbed my appetite and I lost 12lbs in 3 months being on it.

I immediately had a 180 degree mood change. I'd get angry and frustrated so easily. During the 3 weeks of active pills, I often thought I was loosing my mind.  I was so depressed, tired, sleepy, disinterested in everything. During the last week of pills, I felt absolutely great. I was light-hearted, jovial, energetic. My periods were lighter and lasted for fewer days; I wasn't so badly bloated. But I felt hungry all the time.  I gained 10 pounds in six months cause I felt so depressed and un-motivated to do anything.  After seeing some commercials about lawsuits relating to Yasmine, Yaz, and Ocella, I really started educating myself on the drug.  Everything this drug was supposed to help turned out to be symptoms I'd developed after starting to use it.  I never suffered PMDD before OCella, but I developed similar symptoms while using it.  As I said, the last week of pills in the 28-day made me feel great, but 2 days into the active pills of the next pack and I'd start feeling like trash. I really monitored myself with Ocella over the past two months and reveiwed my emotions over the previous 4 months, and I didn't like who I was becoming or what I was feeling.  I definitely didn't like the side effects.  I've now switched back to Apri (Desogen).  Apri has been wonderful for me since I've been taking it, and I am so happy to be switching back.

After the first week or so I started having severe stomach pain. My Dr. tested me for a stomach bacteria called H. Pylori as it had the same symptoms as I was having: bloating, tirendess, throwing up, strange appetite chage. The test came back negative. After further looking into what had changed in my life the only thing that was left was the switch to the Ocella. I am no longer taking the pills and will be getting a perscription for Yasmin again.

If you're considering taking it for acne, think again.\", 'Since being switched from Yasmin to generic Ocella, the only day I did not have severe stomach cramps and diarrhea 3+ times, was the day after I accidentally missed a pill.

I switched from nuvaring to ocella three months ago and I'm writing this now because it's been a long enough time to know how it really works for me. I'm starting to notice an improvement in my skin. It wasn't ever really bad or anything but it seems like it's definitely better, each day I wake up without any new pimples so hopefully that can continue until it's all the way cleared up. I am using a new skin care too so it's not entirely the birth control, but I used the same skin care before on nuvaring and didn't see as good of results as I am now. I haven't gotten pregnant. I started this when I started a new relationship a little while back. We don't have STD's and it's monogamous so we haven't used condoms or anything else so it's doing it's job perfectly. It is a little tedious sometimes because I worry about forgetting, so that's why I gave it four stars on ease of use. The packaging also makes it really easy to follow. Some birth control pills have unnecessarily complicated packs. One thing worth mentioning is with ocella if you only miss one pill and then double up, or take it before that as soon as you remember the effectiveness isn't compromised. It says so in the insert. So that gives a little more room for error than other brands. I did gain some weight, but I was about eight pounds below my normal weight, which was also was already below a typically healthy weight. It was kind of a concern because my normal weight is only 98 pounds (I'm 5 ft. 2 in. tall)and I gained back about five pounds. So for me that was good, and I don't know if it's entirely the birth control but since around the second month I was taking it I have been feeling more hungry and just having a easier time eating more. I lost that weight to begin with because I generally lose my appetite when I'm under a lot of stress, which I have been because I start college really soon and a few other things. So that wasn't a issue for me. But generally, I really like ocella.\", \"I haven't had any reactions with this except for an occasional mood swing and I have gained a few pounds.

I would recommend trying this form of birth control.\", \"24 yrs old, healthy. Been on Ocella for 14 months.  Take it at the same time every night. It's made my period lighter/shorter with a lot less cramping.  Has helped clear up mod. acne. Works great as birth control - still kid free. My only complaint is emotional side effects, which I began noticing about 6 months after starting Ocella. I'm super emotional for 1-2 wks before my period (never had any PMS symptoms before). Tiniest thing bothers me & can ruin my whole day.  I get very irrational & impatient. I feel as if I've gone insane about 2 wks each month. Worst part is that I *know* I'm being ridiculous, but I can't pull myself out of it. I was on anti-depressants for 3 yrs (have been off for 4+ yrs) and this makes me feel like I may be getting depressed again each month. I feel bad for my poor husband, who takes the brunt of this craziness. The only time I really feel 'normal' is while I'm on my period (taking the 'placebo' pills). I'm going to the doctor this Friday to see if I can switch to something else - maybe a birth control pill that has a more gradual hormonal transition throughout the month.\\n\\nBirth Control:  A+              \\nEmotional Roller Coaster:  NO FUN\", \"I went on birth control before becoming sexually active to regulate my periods (they were HORRIBLE before) and to clear up my acne (mild to moderate).

Although it still gives me mild nausea, breast tenderness (especially during my period), and back pain, it has completely cleared up my acne! Now I only get one or two pimples right before my period instead of a full-fledged breakout! It also regulates my periods; my period starts on the third day of the placebo pill, and lasts until the day after I start a new pack. They're also a bit lighter, which is good. The only real problem I have with it is that it can be hard to remember to take my pill. It's not as bad, since I always use condoms, but I still would like to be able to take them consistently.

Worst of all, my mood swings and anxiety skyrocketed- I felt horribly depressed for no reason and would randomly burst into tears, which is frighteningly uncharacteristic of me.  I was tested for a variety of conditions and thought I was going crazy when all the results came back normal, until I started researching my birth control and realized that the timeline fit perfectly.

I've gained weight because I never feel full, I've been an emotional wreck, crying one minute, laughing the next, and going as far as fighting with my boyfriend on Christmas for no apparent reason. I feel like a total whack job who could rip her ovaries out!!! Not only are there emotional and food issues, there are physical issues as well. My LEGS ARE KILLING ME!!! I went as far as going to my doctor last week and getting them to run every test they could to determine what was going on. All my tests were negative. After reading all of these reviews, I think it's safe to say that it's Ocella that is making me feel this way. I'm tired of feeling nauseated and sick all the time. I have an appointment with my OBGYN tomorrow THANK GOD and am hoping to get this all taken care of!\", \"OMG!  I can't believe that I have been taking this crap for as long as I have.  I started seeing ads for patients who had had problems taking this drug so I started doing some research.  I worry about the meds I take because my mom has a clotting disorder.  I was worried that I may have it too and with all the issues surrounding this drug I wanted to make sure that I wasn't taking something that was endangering my health.  I have had problems with sharp pains in my chest (which I thought was just muscle spasms), issues with mood swings, weight gain, and tons of problems with my eyes.  I have been near sighted since I was 7 and worn contacts since I was 13 and never once have I had an issue with it.  In the last year I have only been able to wear my contacts for a few days a week if that.  My eyes stay dry, itchy and feel swollen and irritated all the time.  I just thought it was me but now I am seriously thinking it is the meds.  I do NOT recommend this drug for anyone.  I have stopped taking it all together.  \", 'I briefly took Yasmin before being switched to Ocella (probably due to insurance reasons).  While I absolutely do not agree that generics are the same or always as good as the real thing, I have not had any problems with the change.  I have panic attacks, but did not notice any difference in anxiety or moods.  The only thing was that I get menstrual headaches on occasion.  If I avoid alcohol and drink water, they are not an issue.', \"I swithed from Yasmin and have had no problems at all. My periods are very light and no PMS or side effects. I'm sad I have to switch to something else.\", 'This medication kept me from getting pregnant, and that\\'s the only good thing I can say about it.\\nLike many other women on here, I have experienced extreme side effects from Ocella. I have had intermittent lower back pains ever since my insurance switched from Yasmin.

I would not recommend this product to anyone.\\n\\nI would rather pay $20 extra for Yasmin than go through this debilitating pain.', \"I have had the absolute worst time with this. I stay sick all the time. It has made me so nauseated. I've had many break outs. Also my period is delayed whenever I go on the white pills. My breasts are tender and many times I think I'm pregnant due to the symptoms.\", \"Reading others' posts was a real comfort to me. I've been on Ocella (after switching from Yasmin due to increased costs from my insurance company) for two months and I've experienced a number of full days of nausea varying from slight to severe. Obviously, I take this medication to prevent pregnancy but the symptoms make you paranoid that you ARE pregnant! I also fainted two weeks ago and am now wondering if it was related to the Ocella. I'm going to remain on the drug for another few months, but if things don't improve I will have to consider an alternative.  \", \"I've been on the BCP for about 20 years, and Yasmin for at least 8 of those and love it. I decided to try Ocella a few months ago to save money. It's terrible! Bloating, breakthrough bleeding, etc... getting of it in 2 days and very happy about that. I've read a lot of similar stories on-line. Be careful. \", \"I just finished my first month on Ocella today and so far so good. I just read a bunch of these reviews and am not feeling ANY of the side effects that I have seen. No headaches, no cramping, no anxiety. Not saying it won't come but I havent had any problems. I havent really noticed my acne getting too much better but Im going to give it a couple more months. I got acne only after getting the Mirena, THAT is a bc i DO NOT advise anyone to take. I bled like crazy after having it removed but three days of Ocella stopped the bleeding completely. I also have horrible feet cramps and have noticed those lightening up. My period started on the third day of the white pills and is down to nothing now on the last day of the white pill, only need for a light day liner. Im happy with Ocella, I just hope hope hope it clears my face completly. That would be amazing!!! I want my clear skin back! Good luck ladies!\", \"My Pharmacy stopped getting Zarah and switched me to Ocella. The stated they were one in the same. I am a little upset about this because they are not one in the same. I have been taking the Ocella for one and a half months and have gained 15 pounds! I am been to the gym everyday and the weight does not go away!! Also, it is a struggle to get out of bed and motivated all I want to do is sleep! Changing pharmacy's to get back on Zarah and to lose this weight Ocella has caused! \", \"So far, so good.  I was on Aviane 28 for about five months - became depressed, anxious, paranoid, head pains, sleeping problems, caused fights with my boyfriend and family at least 5 to 6 times a week.  I finally switched to Ocella and have been taking it for about three days now (I only gave it three stars, because it has only been three days).  Since switching, I can honestly say I feel like myself again!  I don't want to cry all the time, I am not worried for no reason, have been sleeping better and no more shooting pains in my head.  I also have noticed I am back to my happy care free self, thank god!  Only complaint is that I get a bit dizzy about once a day and I am a little tired at night (apparently this is common when switching pills).  Will report back after about a month.  Oh, and for people wondering, skin looks better (never really had skin problems, but Aviane definitely made my skin dull/yellowish), have not gained weight yet - actually have lost 2 lbs, and no bloating or tummy issues to report.  I am less hungry than usual though.    \", \"I have been struggling with Acne since middle school (I'm 22 now), and wanted to go back on BC to clear up my skin and also because I'm in a relationship.  Ocella broke me out like CRAZY the first month.  It was bad and I was really depressed.  Knowing that it takes about 3 months for your body to adjust, I stuck with it.  By the second month my skin had cleared up and am very pleased with this BC.  I've noticed its not so good to take before bed, it keeps me up, and lack of sleep leads to irritability and mood swings so I recommend taking it in the morning.  Not much bloating compared to other pills I've tried, but my boobs have definitely gotten bigger which I like.  I'm on my third pack and plan on sticking with it for a while.\", \"Worst birth control ever. Literally made me have the worst cramps, acne, mood swings, depression and anger towards everybody.

I am so pleased with this bc. However, i had a very abnormal mood swing the second day into my period this month, I felt really depressed and cried for no reason but it passed. I have a lot of self control so I made myself cheer up. i think a lot of people have issues doin that for themselves but Im pretty good with it :) My skin starting breaking out when i got the mirena and continued when i got it taken out even.

If you are in a similar situation, you have probably read many reviews about Ocella's affects on your skin that sounded almost like horror stories. Don't let them scare you! Yes, your skin does get much worse during the first month. This is your bodies reaction to the new hormone levels. DO NOT start this pill if you have a big event coming up in the next month (wedding, etc) because you will be miserable. Good news is, if you stick with it for three months you'll see an awesome improvement. I would recommend talking with your derm to get on Tretinoin and also a sulfa cream like Prascion to help with breakouts and to prevent scarring. The combination of all these drugs together worked well for me.\", \"I'm on the fourth month of Ocella.  I've been using it to regulate my periods.  I have 7 day periods and it has brought it down to 4 days but they are VERY HEAVY 4 days. My periods are mores mested up now than before.  I snap at everything and cry over nothing.

It was cheaper and I didn't think much of it. I'm on my second and last month of Ocella. My period was extremely heavy, crazy mood swings, extremely sensitives breasts, and I even got an outbreak of acne, which has never happened. I will definitely be switching back to Yasmin to say the least. Ocella is not worth saving a few bucks.\", \"The first couple of weeks I was sick, stomach aches, headaches, moody and had no appetite. Overall is was a ok pill to take besides the serious side effect. I just recently got off the pill and I've been having serious cramps but no period and I'm urinating more.

Overall, my periods were short and manageable. If I took the pill without food, I sometimes vomited. The worst side effect I experienced was frequent IBS symptoms. Depending on what I ate (or sometimes just randomly), I would get constipation, horrible stomach pains, cold sweats, diarrhea, and nausea that would last for hours. It was awful and very inconvenient. Luckily, when I switched birth control pills, these symptoms subsided.', 'I started taking Ocella a few months before getting married to get use to the pill. Ocella cleared my skin and it looked so nice! BUT I had a lot of the common side effects. I had headaches everyday I was on the white pills (the week of my period) and started noticing I was having weird pains in my arms and legs, just the right side of my body. I decided to stop because the headaches were draining me. Ocella stimulates hair growth so once I stopped I started losing hair. That was scary and took a while to stop happening. Its worth a try, if you are looking to clear up your skin. Keep in mind there is a class action lawsuit against, YAZ/OCELLA/YAZMIN so it may be worth it to try something else.', \"I have been on Ocella for about 1 week. I haven't had any side effects. No weight gain, no acne and I read that it would make you eat a lot, it doesn't. I dont feel different whatsoever. Im not moody nor have I had a decrease in my sex drive. \", \"I've been taking Ocella for about a year and a half and I am pretty happy with the results.  I suffer from non-severe acne but it's still really annoying so even if I wasn't sexually active I would still take it because I never have breakouts even when I'm on my period.  It's amazing!  I have noticed my hair is growing like weeds, which I don't really mind and my nails seem to be stronger as well. I have to say, the first few months were not easy with this birth control.  I think it takes a few months for your body to get used to it and adjust because after a couple of months I was fine.  I do get headaches pretty often which I did not have before taking this BC.  Overall, I would recommend Ocella to anyone. \", \"I have been on ocella for just a few months, but I think everyone's body must react differently to different BC. The last BC I was on was Trinessa and I stopped taking it b/c I had horrible anxiety and didn't feel like myself.  Ocella is a huge improvement over this.  So far, it hasn't helped my acne and it's actually been really bad in the last 2 months.  I'm hoping that will improve with time.  The only side effect I've noticed is a lack of sex drive, which is usually low for me anyway, but it's much worse now.  I am happy that I feel like myself though and it doesn't seem to affect my mood.\", 'testerone level has dropped from 600 to 46.  period bleeding has been much lighter and only lasts for 4 days compared to  or 8 days.', \"I have terrible PMDD and will go from happy and laughing to crying in a matter of minutes.

I was put on the pill at 16 because of the craziness associated with my cycle.  I have been very pleased after 7 months (which is when I usually start to feel the effects of the PMDD coming back).  \", \"My yasmin was replaced by ocella by my insurance company.  After reading several reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I didn't think it was any different at first, but after about 6-9 months, I felt horrible.  Never any nausea or anything others reported, but it sent me into early menopause (age 40).  My GYN didn't really believe me, but I got the lab tests to back it up.  My hair was falling out in clumps, horrible night sweats, weight gain, irritability, and then the hot flashes started.  After going off the drug, all of my symptoms got worse at first - but after about 6 weeks, I started feeling better.  I went about 4 months without a menstrual cycle and then I rebounded into puberty or something.  Now I have a VERY heavy period every 21 days, my normal skin is now extremely oily and I have developed acne.  Having never had oily skin, I still haven't figured out how to treat it.  I've spent hundreds of dollars on various treatments, but nothing seems to work.  I guess I'm just going to have to go back on some sort of hormone again, but NEVER ocella.  Don't think I'd even go back to Yasmin since I don't want to risk the same thing happening.\", \"Ive been on Ocella for about a year now.

I have literally been to the doctors office a dozen times in the last month because of the side effects I've had. I went in for an MRI, was tested for a urniary tract infection and was put on antibiotics for it, but when the culture results came back.. it was negative. So i called a phone nurse to tell her about the pain i was was having, and that there was still blood in my urine. and she thought i may have kidney stones. Went to go see the doctor today..

I had a really bad headache and was nauseous with every meal. Once I developed an appetite I put on about 6 lbs. For a while I hated it. My periods are shorter, lighter, and less painful then they used to be which is a huge plus. I got a yeast infection with my second pack and have noticed that my stomach is a little more sensitive with the food that I'm used to eating. It is getting better with each month and I can honestly say I'm not complaining anymore but the first three months kinda suck.  \", 'I have been taking Ocella for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great for me! Not only has it been an excellent birth control, I have far less breakouts and cramping than i had before taking the pill. I highly recommend Ocella.', \"I had my last pill of Ocella yesterday and I am glad. My gynecologist prescribed me Yasmin to get me all set up because my husband and I are going to start the treatment for in-vitro fertilization, and since I am trying to control my acne as well, he suggested  to try this pill. CVS gave me Ocella and I didn't think it was going to be a big deal because they told me Ocella is the generic form of Yasmin and cheaper. At first I didn't notice any changes at all in my body or emotions, but the last 2 weeks have been hell. I have been in a really bad mood. My acne became worse than before. I was taking medication for acne and it was controlled, now I have huge pimples on my cheeks, it depresses me even more. My dermatologist changed my acne medication and injected cortisone on some pimples, but they won't go away!! I also lost a lot of weight and somehow I have to gain it back because now I am underweight. When I told my dermatologist about Ocella, he said that sometimes even though the pills may contain the same ingredients, they are not made the same way and somehow the body may react differently to certain generic drugs. He said next time to stick to Yasmin and now I hope my pimples go away ASAP. \", 'So I just switched from beyaz to ocella less then a month ago and so far do not see any changes. However, I had a question in regards to the placebo pills. Beyaz had 4 of those pills and ocella has 7. Does this make a huge difference? and is my body reading this as \"oh no, she is skipping pills\" since it is so used to the beyaz cycle. Please let me know!', 'This pill has worked fine for me. I had nausea at first, but after a few weeks it stopped. I did gain weight, but that is a minor issue if you just exercise.', \"I had a great experience with Ocella. I had been on a generic birth control since I was 16 (for about 10 years). Initially, my acne cleared up, but I was also using Proactive at the same time. I kept using the same BC when I quit proactive about 5 years ago. \\n\\nMy acne came back furiously. It only just recently became worse, however. After documenting it for several months (pictures and steps) I asked my doc to switch my birth control after reading reviews. My friend, who had been on Yaz, cautioned against it because she had a terrible experience. But because I was initially on a generic drug, I didn't have ANY bad experiences and I'm on my fourth month. It would seem that the bad experiences come mostly from those who initially used Yaz. Thus, I believe Ocella is a good option for hormonal acne. I have continued to document my skin with pictures and I have seen an actual change from my time on Ocella.\\n\\nAlso, please note I use very gentle face wash (CeraVe) with PanOxyl 3% benzoyl peroxide treatment which helps take care of spots.\\n\\nI hope this helps. If you are considering switching, it is important to discuss with your doctor and understand that people's bodies do react different to different medications.\", 'I have been on Ocella for about two months. I had to switch from safryal because my insurance did not cover it anymore. At first I initially really liked this birth control. I had lost weight and for the most part was overal happy. As time went on I realized everyday I cried at least once. My mood would go from happy to sad in seconds and I could never renounce from that. I do not feel like myself and I am getting off this pill at the end of this month. Everyone is different but there have been way to many low satisfaction rates for this pill. ', \"I have been on Ocella for about 3 months. It may have helped with my skin but not a noticeable change. I already had anxiety but it got 10xs worse taking this. I feel anxious 99% of the time. I have bad mood swings. One second I'm happy the other im upset. Other than making me a raging lunatic I haven't noticed any other side affects. I plan on getting off of this ASAP. This is just my opinion and birth control works differently on everybody.

My acne was maybe a 6.5/10. I took Ocella daily with the hope that my acne would die and be left with the clear skin I've always wanted. Sadly, my acne worsened terribly! It became a 11/10. Never had my acne been so aggravated. My cheeks became full of cysts. My chin \", 'I took Ocella for almost a year and recently had to stop it because it made me CRAZY. I was always depressed, sad, withdrawn, I cried constantly for no reason and my emotions went from 0 to 100 in a matter of a second.

Within a matter of days after stopping it I felt way better and more like myself! I would not recommend this to anyone!', 'I have been on Ocella for almost two years now. I have experienced no weight gain, my face is constantly clear, no mood swings, and I have had a lot of \"accidents\" and this pill has never failed me! Also, I have wanted to skip my period a few times and did it on this medication with no break through bleeding', \"Just finished my first pack of Ocella, and while I can't give a very in-depth review on it (because 1 month is too short) I will say that I am very pleased so far! This is the 3rd birth control pill I have tried, the first two were absolute nightmares. So bad that I quit the pill all-together for about 2 years but just decided to start back up again with Ocella. I was on Kariva and then switched to Minastrin. I had awful awful weight gain with both. I did not change my diet, it was all water weight that was lost within a week of stopping the pills. So far, on Ocella I have not gained any weight and I do not feel bloated or puffy. I am assuming that has to do with the fact that the progestin has a diuretic in it, which I am all for if it keeps bloating at bay! The first few days of taking this pill I had extreme nausea and upset stomach, but that luckily went away completely. I also had a few bad headaches, but I got that before taking Ocella so I cannot say for sure that it was caused by this pill. I know there are a lot of scary reviews on here, but that can be expected for every pill. I will say, though, that given my past experience with birth control I was terrified of taking this pill. So far, thankfully, it has been a breeze. I am hoping that it continues to be like this! Give it a shot and see how it works for you. Unfortunately, you won't know until you try it. But, if you have struggled with other pills in the past this may be the one for you (especially if weight gain was an issue)!\", 'I had been on Ocella since I was 14. I recently stopped taking it because the side effects were too much with the stress of me in nursing school. Over the first year on Ocella, I had terrible uncontrollable cravings that led me to gain 30lbs. My weight fluctuates normally without the pill but this was the most weight Iâ??ve ever gained. Even when trying with diet and exercise, I cannot lose the weight, which is one reason I switched. Lately with my school, I noticed a change in my mood, having depressive thoughts that I have never had. It ultimately was affecting my thoughts and happiness. My boyfriend over the years (who has been with me the entire time Iâ??ve been on it) has noticed a change in my mood and well being. I had breakthrough bleeding every month on the second week of the pack. I also lost all my once high sex drive, to the point I have no desire to have sex or anything romantic. My thoughts, extreme weight gain, and lack of drive to do anything were unlike anything Iâ??ve ever experienced, which is why I switched after 6 years on it and started my new pill today. Goodbye Ocella!', 'ive been taking ocella for about 7 months and ive had an amazing experience with it! at first i was extremely moody and i experienced pms for the first time ever as i hadnt had my period for four months prior to starting this birth control. I always struggled with irregular periods and hormonal acne caused by me not having my period regularly so i tried ocella as my first choice and it did me wonders! i never experienced pms and emotions the way that i am now and it is really nice. but it has also cleared my acne tremendously! i struggled with nausea and mood swings but no headaches. i didnt experience any weight gain either, actually i lost weight in all the right places and gained weight in all the right places! i really recommend if you struggle with irregular periods and hormonal acne!', \"DO NOT TAKE THIS! My insurance switched me from Zarah to Ocella, and it was hell. I was on my period the entire 2 and a half weeks I took them, which as you know isnt supposed to happen. I broke out SO bad. I had completely clear skin before them. I was so moody. I cried for no reason at all. I was depressed and I gained about 10 pounds. Needless to say, I got back on Zarah as soon as possible. If some one tells you zarah and ocella are interchangeable, smack them in the face. The only good thing about this drug is that I didn't get pregnant.This drug should be removed from the market.\", \"Yaz, Yazmin and Ocella are literally poison. I started on it when I was 16 to straighten out my hormones and began having migraines every time I would get my period. I thought it was normal and continued taking it until I was 20, when I started getting sick because of the migraines. I would throw up for days, had to miss class numerous times and even considered going to the emergency room. Never in my life had I experienced such pain. Prior to taking Ocella, I would never get them. Now every time I try to go on a different brand of birth control my body has been conditioned to get sick from this one. Please don't take Ocella. It is by far one of the worst mistakes I have ever made in my life.\", \"Let me start by saying I have not taken this BC. I had been on Avianne for a yr. when I was swithed to Ocella. My doc thought a higher dose of hormone would help me. I read these reviews and decided to stick with what I had. I would rather have a longer period than risk the side effects mentioned here since I already have health problems. I would like to clear something up though. There have been a lot of complaints of stomach issues. This BC contains a med. similar to one called Spirilactone. I take this in addition to my BC for help with PCOS Spirilactone's main side effect is diahrea and stomach upset. By these reviews I don't think most women realize that this is a contributing factor. You may want to talk to your doc about a BC that doesn't have this ingredient. Also always be informed about any medicine you take.\", 'I have PCOS and I was taking Ocella to ameliorate my symptoms: acne, hair loss, irregular periods. While taking the pill ALL these symptoms were helped immensely. In fact my skin never looked so good. Unfortunately, I also had weight gain (about 10lbs), I felt sluggish, and my mood was poor. So I stopped taking it. Hopefully, I will find the right pill for me soon.', 'I have taken Ocella for many years. The main problem I have is if I am just a few hours later than usual taking it, I have spotting for several days. Very annoying. My doctor recently told me that Ocella/Yaz have been connected to an increase in blood clots so I am switching to Necon.', 'I was given Ocella as a generic form of Yasmin. Yasmin didn\\'t affect me too much minus turning me emotional. Ocella on the other hand did a number on me. My skin cleared up, but thats about it. I gained weight, probably 10-15 lbs which is a lot when I\\'m 5\"2 and normally around 100. Didn\\'t have any changes in diet or anything. I got headaches all the time. I also had NO sex drive. I basically never wanted to have sex, so I guess that helps if you don\\'t want to get pregnant! I also had the worst anxiety and depression, but i never realized it could have been the pill until now. I was basically a neurotic mess. Someone else mentioned weird pains in their legs, and I had those too! Just little stabs in my legs and I never thought it could be the pill. Just sucks that Yasmin never affected me as bad as this stuff. I have been off it for about 2 months and feel better.', \"My dr put me on ocella as the generic form of Yaz about 2 months ago to help with my acne and I also use it for birth control. I'm very satisfied with the results.

When I first started this it was very hard for me to get used to, I had some cramping ( not during my period) and when my period did come it was a week late and then lasted for almost 2 it was very light though. I feel a little bloated, I don't think I've gained any weight though if I have my bf says it's gone to my boobs and ass. My breasts have gotten fuller and more sensitive much to my bf's delight. other than that nothing big is wrong I hate the bloating but my beautiful clear skin is sooo worth it and no one else notices it but me. I just try to drink more water.\", \"I was on this birth control from the time I was 17 until I was 22. My dermatologist recommended Yasmin for my skin, but I also used to have awful periods. (I experienced basically every bad symptom you can imagine: cramps, heavy bleeding, 10-day periods, acne, mood swings, etc.) Yasmin (and subsequently the generic, Ocella) cleared up my skin, made my periods 100% better: short, minimal cramps, fewer food cravings, significantly reduced PMS. The only reason I went off Ocella is because my insurance changed and my co-pay shot up to $56/month, and I might even go back because I've been experiencing way more side effects on my new birth control. \", \"I have been on Ocella for a few years.\\nI've always had really heavy, long, painful periods. For a few months it kept my bleeding at bay a little bit, but for a while I've been having horrible cramps, bleeding almost every day of the month, and the worst moodswings of all time. \\nI am almost ashamed to say that I spent a long time refilling and not talking to my doctor because I wasn't gaining weight, as I was from the other bc pills I have tried. \\nAfter having to be hospitalized and medicated for my cramps recently, my doctor has put me on Necon 1/35, which I start tomorrow. We'll see..\\nBut I do not recommend Ocella to anyone looking for any period regulation or mood regulation. Had no effect on my PMDD symptoms either, as it seems to be marketed to control.\\n\", \"I took Ocella after my insurance raised the copay for Yasmin. I originally started taking it for horrible cramps, which it alleviated somewhat, but not without side effects. Both caused extreme heaviness and pain in my legs, which hasn't gone away nearly two years after taking the drug. I was off BC for a while, but my cramps were so bad I had to start again - this time my doctor gave me Nuvaring, and so far so good. \", \"I was originally prescribed by my doctor Yas to help treat my acne and then switched to Ocella. I like this pill because it helped my with my acne problems and makes my period last for only 3-4 days and it's so light, i love it! it basically got rid of my cramps but i still lightly break out on my face with a few pimples right before my period's about it hit. Also, i still get cavings and i feel like i can eat my whole fridge and i noticed that i'm more sensitive than usual before i get my period. I would definitely recommend this form of birth control for acne problems, but if you're the more sensitive type, try something else. \", \"About a year ago I started using birth control. When I heard there was a specific bc for acne i asked my doctor about it and she switched me to ocella. This was the BEST thing i ever did for my skin. nothing else i'd tried worked. sixth months ago my insurance changed, i got off of it, my face broke out with cysts & i hate it. i'm now on monocycline & sprintec b/c it's cheaper, but so far it's week 3 and the cysts are still there.\", \"Each person's body is different. Mine did not like Ocella. I had been on the Nuva Ring prior to my 2 week fling with Ocella. The Nuva Ring was not effective for treating my acne so my doctor suggested I try something else. \\n\\nCall me crazy, but I was out of whack within the first 8 days of use. I became very paranoid about many things... being pregnant, in particular. My brain could not reason with my mind that it was near impossible for me to be pregnant when I had always used the Nuva Ring correctly and got my period recently. Nonetheless, I was pretty stressed out because apparently the hormones from the pill were making my breasts so tender to the point that running hurt... a lot. Also I became rather nauseous daily. Both off these are pregnancy symptoms. Perhaps these symptoms would have subdued over time, but for me, it was not worth it. I stopped treatment abruptly, took a pregnancy test (negative) and am back on the Nuva Ring for birth control. I will try a different option for acne. \\n\\nHope this review is helpful for anyone worried and/or wondering if others have had a similar reaction. \", \"I hated this medication! My breast grew and were so sore, I cried at the drop of a hat, my stomach would feel so nauseous! I went to the Dr and had this changed, it kept wasn't meant to keep me from getting pregnant even though that was it's job. I was using it because of the side effects with PCOS! One thing is I lost one pound over a month, but I'm pretty sure it was BC nothing felt right in my stomach!   \", \"Taking ocella was the worst experience of my life. Within a week of taking it, I started having extreme mood swings. I live with my fiance, and we for the first time in our two year relationship we fought pretty much every day and I cried constantly. I was nauseous a lot and felt bloated. My period which normally last three days, with hardly any cramps changed to a week of terrible cramps and only a day or two of bleeding. The worst part was the fact that the inside of my vagina swelled up so tight that i couldn't even have sex. I had no sex drive. It wasn't dry, it was just tight. I could feel how swollen it was  throughout the day. It was extremely uncomfortable. I have been off of it for almost a month now and have not had a period.

This pill has thrown my body completely out of wack. My facial oil production has increased causing severe cystic acne. This will probably now cause scarring for the rest of my life.

Bloating occurs even though this is  a BCP that is supposed to be good to prevent that. I get frequent muscle cramps \"charlie horses\" in my legs and toes. I switched to Ocella 6 months ago from brand name Yasmin. I was fine on Yasmin! Every month my symptoms are increasing. It is scary! This month my breasts are extremely itchy and red/inflammed. I am going to switch to Yaz, even though it is costly. Everyone reacts different to BCPs. I know this one is poison for me. ', 'It has been a long time since I have been on BCP.  I have only been on Ocella for four days.  My second day I had the worst case of diarrhea to the point a lost about 7 pounds.  Now all I feel is heart burn which I never had before I started to take it along with felling nauseas.  I am going to continue to take these BCP but if this feeling of heart burn and nauseas does not go away by the end of this pack I am getting off of this.

Yasmin helped to control all of these symptoms but I was switched to Ocella a three months ago when the generic brand came out.  Since then I have broken out into a full body rash that did not subside for 4 weeks, the facial hair has returned and I have gained 17 pounds.  When I spoke with my doctor they assured me that Ocella was the same as Yasmin. I completely disagree and feel that Ocella should no longer be prescribed to help women with PCOS. It has been nothing but a nightmare.', \"I've not had too many problems with Ocella. Switched over from Yasmin when Ocella came out so I had an opportunity to notice a difference between the two and there wasn't much. I will say I do seem to be getting mentrual headaches where I haven't before but I can't say whether or not they started after the switch or not. I think I just assumed they were age. I don't think I'll go back to paying for Yasmin when I can't see a difference between the two but I will definitely keep potential Ocella issues in mind from here on out\", \"I love Ocella! I was on Yasmin at first for a little over a year before Ocella came out. It was cheaper so I switched. There has been no difference between the two that i can notice. I lost weight, my boobs got bigger, my skin was so clear, and my periods were lighter... shorter... painless... and predictable almost to exact hour. The only thing I didn't like was the very first month I was on Yasmin I had bleeding almost the entire month, but after that I loved it. I recently was dropped from my parents health insurance so its too expensive for me. I'm trying to find ways to get back on it. Every since I stopped taking Ocella my back has broken out with acne.

This has been an excellent medication for me and has helped tremendously.', \"Began with one capsule every other day, this was tolerable. Per doctor's instructions I increased to 3 capsules a day. Within a few days I began experiencing adverse side effects. Fatigue that's almost depilatating, headache that generates nausea, back pain and overall body pain. Felt like I had been beaten with a baseball bat. Kept taking hoping to adjust, took for 2 weeks, finally quit. It's been 4 days off of meds, beginning to experience colitis symptoms again. Fatigue, headache are slow to go away. In my case, the treatment is worse because I am asymptomatic unless I experience a flair. Not eating is preferred treatment at this point. Sounds extreme, liquid diet helps me.\", \"I took it 3 capsules in the morning for joint pain and small flare up. I only have mild to moderate Crohns.

A couple of months later my OLD Gastro weaned me down to one - very wise indeed.  All was good.  My NEW Gastro put me back on the 3 caps for a yer now when I begged him that I was doing well and could he PLEASE wean me off.  Nope.  So, as of a couple of months ago, I have gained 40 pounds, moon face and hump back, edema, high blood pressure, got Thrush, AND today I found out I am now diabetic (My GP says all of this is due to being on Entecort too long).

In a week I was exercising and going out. The loose stools have continued but I was much more confident about traveling and took up running. The dosage was 3 pills for 6 weeks then tapering to 2 for a week and 1 for a week. The day after tapering (week 6.1) I was in great pain so I am starting a new eight week course of Entocort today.

For those of you struggling with results from this medication, I have a few comments to make about my time on Entocort and how I think it is more effective.  I did not drink ANY alcohol.  I have found that any alcohol (even just a single drink) makes symptoms MUCH worse and made it difficult for the medication to work to its full potential.  I also stopped taking any kind of oral mesalamine, but continued using the suppository, Canasa.  This obviously is not professional medical advice and I encourage you to speak with your Doctor about this.  Lastly, I started supplementing with Cod Liver Oil.  The Vitamin D in the Cod Liver Oil did wonders for my colon/large intestine.  I was symptom free for about 14 months until just recently I've had to go back onto Entocort due to recent stress.  I am not, by any means, a Cod Liver Oil sales/spokesperson, however; I do feel that supplementing with the gel caps have greatly contributed to my success of staying in remission.

    "medical_condition":"Acne",
    "medical_condition_description":"Acne Other names: Acne Vulgaris; Blackheads; Breakouts; Cystic acne; Pimples; Whiteheads; Zits Acne is a skin condition caused by dead skin cells sticking together and clogging up pores. Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from acne worse than others. Bad acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skin’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your acne. It is a myth that you have to let acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin. See a dermatologist if you feel shy or products don't work.",

It also never changed my period cycle...I still experienced cramps and heavy periods. Fact is I have a great life with a wonderful boyfriend and I hated the way this pill made me act toward people and inside. I wanted my positive self back. So glad to be off this horrible thing they call medicine. Since I switched, my moods have slowly been getting better and I actually did not overreact to anything for the first time in a while.

Although it was a little heavier than usual, it didn't bother me because at least it came on time. I didn't gain any weight on these pills either which was great; however, the main reason I am going off them is because of the severe mood swings I experienced.

Very dissatisfied. \", 'I went through several types of birth control pills before I was put on tri-previfem. They all made me emotional, none of them could control my cramps or my period regularity, and they were just overall unsatisfying. This birth control has solved all of my problems.

I would highly recommend. \", 'I have been taking Tri-Previfem since mid-November 2014. As birth control, it is effective. However, my emotional state has gotten to quite a bad place when it was nowhere near this before; my moods have worsened. It has seemed like a downward spiral. I have been experiencing depression, anxiety, anger, aggression, and, most recently, crying spells. This is not good for me, my significant other, or the people around me. The negative emotions do not only come on my period, but also at other times of the month. A few months ago, I began taking a female endocrine support supplement (Gynecrine) to help with my moods.

I have been on this pill for just under 4 months and it has completely changed me. I have been petite my entire life and it has made me gain 15 pounds even though I eat very well and exercise (high intensity) daily. It has destroyed my self image and my confidence has plummeted. Tri Previfem has made me experience migraines (which I have literally never had before), horrible stomach pain every day, constant hunger, and lack of control over my emotions. I always feel like I could start crying for no reason. On the bright side, I'm not pregnant and it's helped clear up my skin, but the side effects outweigh the benefits.

Long story short, I went to the doctor and she drew some blood.  After that she sent me straight to the hospital to have an ultrasound done and now I have the unfortunate pleasure of being on blood thinner medication because I have a BLOOD CLOT behind my left knee.

My patience and ability to deal with stress is not what it once was. I find myself crying througout the day for various reasons. Prior to taking this medication, I used an anti-anxiety drug that I would take at the onsight of anxiety. However, after starting the Tri-Previfem, I've had to start taking the anti-anxiety medication on a daily basis just to counteract the emotional side effects that come with it. I wouldn't be able to function otherwise because I would be fighting with my husband constantly or threatening to walk off my job. Other changes that I have noticed include breast swelling, which I can't say that I mind ;-), but the tenderness can be very uncomfortable. I also noticed that my skin is more sensative to the sun, so using sunblock is a must, as it should always be. On a good note, I have not expericend any problems with acne, as this medication is said to either clear up acne, or cause it. The biggest drawback is definatley the emotional side-effects. \\n  Since I have the option of using an anti-anxiety medication alongside the Tri-Previfem, I am able to use this medication. If you do not have this option, then I wish you good look on your emotional journey, or suggest that you switch to something else. \", 'I became severely depressed and lethargic after taking this for only a couple weeks.

I wouldn't recommend people *not* take it, but I would certainly tell them my experience so they could decide if they wanted to try it. My Dr called in a new bcp but wants me to finish this pack first. Needless to say, I am very anxious to get off this one. \", \"My doctor prescribed it to help treat my acne breakouts and to help control my hormones/PMS issues. I'm 19 yrs old. My menses has been light, emotional level is more stable, but a 20 lb. weight gain is harsh. I'm on my third Rx so weight gain has happened fast. I'm having stretch marks appear under my arms, breastsand thighs. My breasts have gone up a cup size, and I get extremely sore lymph nodes under my arms.\\nI'm gonna go back to my doctor to reevaluate my Rx for my situation.\", \"Hello ladies. I just turned 20 this June, awaiting my 20s to be the beginning to a whole new chapter in my life. And it most certainly was....but not the one I expected. I've been on Tri-previfem for almost a year (I started August 2014) and the reason I went on it was because of my acne. Luckily, acne went away, I didn't gain weight and I was loving life. I wish I could still be in that lovely place instead, I have to tell you, for the past 2 months I have been experiencing tremendous anxiety, depression, confusion about life, and just complete and utter hell. I have always been in good mental and physical health and this change was so out of the blue; I kept thinking I was mentally insane, and that nothing was going to cure me. LADIES, I repeat....get off that f***ing pill. It is the devil. Keep a journal of your symptoms if you don't believe me, but it's been the only hope I have and I found a correlation with my pill cycle. I'm still recovering now, I've decided to get off the pill and It's still been quite the horrible journey. But keep your head up high, pray to the Lord, and He will guide you back to peace. God Bless and I hope you find what you are looking for. \", \"I had high hopes for this birth control, because when I went to my gynecologist specifically for birth control to help acne, she made it sound like ortho tri-cyclen was my best option. I've been taking it for somewhere around 6 months, and I don't quite know how to feel about this birth control. My family says it's helped, and I've noticed myself that it's lowered the severity of my acne. Not to the point I'm very happy, but also not to the point I want to stop using it. If I use it just on its own with no other acne treatments, I seem to get a normal amount (usually 2-4 pimples on my face regularly), but when I use Pond's Cold Cream twice a day and moisturize with aloe vera gel at night, I've noticed quick improvement.\\nOverall, my experience with this drug is mediocre compared to what I had hoped. \", \"I've been on this medication for almost two years now. This was my third type of birth control and the one that finally caused me periods to regulate. Due to a number of outside factors, I am just now realizing that triprevifem is to thank for  my increased emotional state. I used to be the girl who NEVER cried, now, I'm luck if I make it a week without crying. It is nice to finally have regular periods, however, it would be nice to not cry, too, especially considering it has almost been detrimental to my relationship. I'm going to look into switching medications.  \", \"I took Tri-Previfem in order to help my acne, all in all that was good. Until the two weeks before my period. The entire couple weeks I was weeepy, extra-sensitive, jealous, etc. So, to say the least I had some mood swings. I felt like I needed to leave a review because I have felt so out of control of my emotions for the past couple weeks and it started to lead to me wanting to just avoid any contact with people and stay in bed all day, which, I think, resembles depression. On the bright side, my acne is so much better than it was before I started taking it, I only have a few break outs occasionally due to not washing my face well enough after exercise. I didn't gain a bunch of weight, although I did notice that I have been retaining water for the week before my period, but I'm not able to rule out it being from me starting to exercise as well this week.\", \"First birth control pill I ever started taking because of horrible periods. The one positive is it did help with the some of the heaviness and my period was consistent but let me give you the cons. While taking this pill I have experienced major weight gain, around 15-20 pounds. I feel bloated a lot and have major mood swings. This drug messes with your emotions a lot. I will get upset and cry over anything along with being super mean or irritable when something makes me mad or doesn't go my way. Causes major mood problems like depression and anxiety. I feel bad for the people around me. It did clear up my face but these last couple of months I have broken out pretty bad. Currently changing to another pill. This one may be cheap but it is not for everyone. \", \"I am satisfied with it bc I am not pregnant & bc I always kno when my period will come which before the pill I had no clue , but as for the constant reoccurring yeast infections & all the moodiness & crying everyone else mentioned I am not satisfied. I didn't kno I should attribute my weight gain to this at 22 years old I just thought it was happening with age but I just read several other reviews here that said they had the similar weight gain I just experienced in the last year, & I've always been very skinny but I guess bc of this that I've gained about 15 lbs & my stomach is very bloated to the point ppl think I'm pregnant. I am deciding to stop this pill I'm tired of all this, my acne has also not gotten any better so screw it. Hopefully I won't get pregnant too soon but dealing with all this just for free pills has gotten old.\", \"I started taking birth control mainly to help with cramps.  Before birth control I was in pain for 24 hours straight.  Pain killers didn't work, and I had to suffer from vomiting, nausea, dizziness, and diarrhea.  My periods we extremely heavy and lasted 10 days, every time.  Tri-Previfem has worked wonders for these symptoms over the past 3 years.  I'm no longer confined to the bathroom and I can actually function like a normal human being.  My periods last 7 days on average, so at least that has decreased somewhat.  The other reason I got on birth control was to help with acne.  I've struggled with acne since I was 12.  I got everything from blackheads to big red welts.  When I started taking the pill, my face flared up at first, but over time it gradually got better.  People even pointed out that my complexion looked so much better.  After being on this pill for 3 years I can say that is no longer the case.  My acne is terrible again and I'm back to getting large red welts all over my cheeks and jawline.  I've heard that symptoms can return after being on medication for a number of years, so maybe that's the case for me.  Besides my acne returning, I've had other side effects occur throughout the last year.  My mood swings are terrible!  I often go off on people for no reason and I feel like my blood is boiling.  Not only that, but my face flushes quite often.  If I'm angry, hot, embarrassed, or experiencing any uncomfortable emotion, my face will become red as a tomato.  Needless to say, even though this pill has been amazing for my cramps, it has a lot of negative side effects, and I probably won't continue taking it much longer.  It's worth a shot, since everyone reacts differently to medication, but don't be surprised if some of these side effects creep up on you.  \", 'Recently started these pills as prescribed by my family physician as i\\'m experiencing irregular menstrual cycles and having trouble conceiving for the past 3 1/2 years. She hopes this will regulate my cycle enough. Started taking these 05/25/2016 and as of today, 06/30/2016, my breasts have gone from a 34C to a 36D. They were tender at first but that subsided.

I have been on BC for 7 years and haven't run into issues until now. I have decided to give my body a break from the drug and see how I feel. \", \"Horrible, horrible, horrible.  After 2 months of taking this pill, I have finally stopped taking it.  Going back to my Dr. to find out what I can be switched to because the emotional strain on me from this pill is just too much.  I was taking TriNessa 28 for 2 months prior to this one and when I switched to order by mail from my insurance they switched the prescription to Tri-Previfem.  The first month I get switched, they have a RECALL because pills were packaged incorrectly.  Thank goodness mine did not end up being part of the recall but still scary enough.  \\n\\nUnfortunately it took a major outburst with a co-worker to finally open my eyes and realize I've had horrible ups and downs in my mood the past two months.  I'm not one of those women that cries at every little thing, until I began taking Tri-Previfem.  I feel like a teenager again who is not in control of her body due to the fluctuating hormones.  My face has broken out horribly along my jawline and now two weeks of being off the pill it's finally starting to clear up.\", 'After Tri Sprintec got recalled, the pharmacy switched me to Tri Previfem.

I would have continued to take it but a poor choice and drive to make more profit by Medco mail order pharmacy backed me into a corner sending me TriPrevifem. Instead of being assertive, I gave this generic a try. WRONG WRONG WRONG. significant increase in mood swings, anxiety, acne (even on my scalp!), breast tenderness, and joint pain.

Zarah also causes changes in your cervical mucus and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus.\nZarah is used as contraception to prevent pregnancy. This medicine is also used to treat moderate acne in women who are at least 14 years old and have started having menstrual periods, and who wish to use birth control pills.\nYaz is also used to treat the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), such as anxiety, depression, irritability, trouble concentrating, lack of energy, sleep or appetite changes, breast tenderness, joint or muscle pain, headache, and weight gain.\nZarah may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.",
    "medical_condition":"Acne",
    "medical_condition_description":"Acne Other names: Acne Vulgaris; Blackheads; Breakouts; Cystic acne; Pimples; Whiteheads; Zits Acne is a skin condition caused by dead skin cells sticking together and clogging up pores. Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from acne worse than others. Bad acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skin’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your acne. It is a myth that you have to let acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin. See a dermatologist if you feel shy or products don't work.",

Since switching, not by choice, I have had incredible discomfort, pain and soreness in my breasts, which I have never had with any of the previous pills I have taken. I am exhausted all the time, feel extreme fatigue and apathetic. I feel like I am depressed - and could not figure out why as nothing has changed except for this medication. I am bloated quite a bit of the time and feel as if I have gained weight but my actual numbers haven't changed. \\nThis pill is supposed to be an exact replica of Yasmin which doesn't make sense in the first place as they banned Yasmin because of adverse effects and lawsuits. So why make the exact pill? Something has to be different because I feel awful all the time - if I didn't know any better I'd swear I was pregnant with how I feel. I am not happy with this change, I was extremely happy using Yasmin.\", 'Used for 6 months now - best birth control pill so far! This is the third brand/type of birth control I have ever been on and it has worked really well for me.  My acne, which was getting bad on my other birth control, is now all clear on Zarah.  After my second month on Zarah, my skin became clear and glowing.  I am 25 years old, 5\\'6\" tall and now weigh 124 lbs.  Since being on Zarah for the last 6 months I have gained 2 lbs, which is normal for me since I fluctuate.  I do get horrible headaches when I take the non-hormone pills.  I try to drink a lot of water and take ibuprofen.  Also, during my period I am very emotional and cry at anything - even sad TV commercials.  However, I am way less emotional through the month than I used to be.  Once I was 5 hours late to take my pill.  Even with the pills being 19 hours apart, I got extremely sick and dizzy after I took the next pill the following day.  So, my advice would be to always take your pills on time.  Also, my insurance doesn\\'t cover this birth control so I pay $56 a month which is slightly high.  However, I was paying $15/month for bc pills and then another $15 for acne pills and another $15 per month for over the counter acne scrubs/face wash/anything that never actually worked.  Now, Zarah is the only acne medication I use it and it works perfectly so far.  Also, my period is regulated and of course, I have not gotten pregnant.

I went to generic Ocella then Zarah within the past 5 years. I have been very satisfied with this pill. I no longer have severe pain during periods, and I am very regular to knowing the specific day and about time of day I will start and stop my period. I do not have acne breakouts.

Very happy with this pill.', \"Recently I quit taking Zarah to try to get pregnant, and I noticed my libido went way up immediately, and suddenly sex wasn't painful anymore.

Day 3 I broke out in hives all over my hips. Thinking it was extremely rare to have this kind of reaction to BC pills I continued taking them. By day 10 the hives began appearing on my fingers, wrists, and upper arms. I immediately stopped taking the pill. All the hives are going away (slowly on my hips). I have recently discovered it is not so rare after all to have allergic reactions (such as hives) to hormones (especially artificial hormones.) Most reports say that if you are allergic to one then you are usually allergic to most, if not all. Thought it was worth reporting on this site in case anyone has the same kind of reaction. I was prepared for the side effects, but not an allergic reaction!   \", \"So I starting taking Zarah after ocella was giving me an bad discharge with an odor. At first I thought I loved Zarah. I went out of my way to go to a Harmon's pharmacy to get it rather than another grocery store. I recently changed insurance and I can no longer get Zarah. I've began taking a new pill which I cannot remember the name of but I have now realized how many PROBLEMS I actually had with Zarah. I've learned that Zarah was causing weird breakouts around my chin that were just hard painful bumps that never turned into actual zits. It was causing my breasts to lactate, by the way I am 21, have been on birth control since 15 and have never been pregnant. After reading another review I have noticed my sex drive go wayyy up as well. My new pill immediately changed my vaginal odor and discharge and at first I hated it but after about a month of using it the odor has gone away quite a bit. I am no longer breaking out, my breasts stopped lactating (Which I was starting to worry about before) and I haven't noticed anything else abnormal.\", 'I agree with the other comment 100%', \"I am 34, haven't been on birth control since I was 20 and I only took it for a year then. I asked my doctor for birth control because my periods were 7 days long and PMS started 2 weeks before my period.  My moods were unbearable.  I was so fatigue.  I was angry, crying, aggravated for at least 2 weeks out of the month and cramping the 3rd week so I only had one good week a month, where I felt like myself. That was not good.  After turning 30 I would break out the week before my period and acne became a big issue. My doctor recommended Zarah.  I have been on Zarah for about three months now.  The first 30 days were the worst with the nausea, moodiness, depression, constipation and bloating...but I read the reviews and a few women said to give it 30 days.  They were right.  After 30 days all of the ugly went away.  I don't have 2 weeks of PMS, I'm never angry for no reason anymore, my period went from 7 days to 3 days (HALLELUJAH!!) and the cramping was minimal.  I can enjoy my life again, and my daughter has a happy mom for more than one week out of the month!  I even got fuller breasts...tee hee hee!  There wasn't really any weight gain, just occasional bloating, but not the usual 6 months pregnant look!  I prayed before I started taking it, and I pray when I take it because I don't want the cons of the medicine, just the pros.  So far...it's working :-) Now I did have low to no sex drive...but it's not consistent...and I'll take that over everything else!\", \"It took me getting off Zarah in order to truly appreciate it. Ocella is just not the same. I have no idea why, it's just not. On this pill, I had a high sex drive, easily got wet, little acne, and my bleeding issues were resolved for the first couple of years. After about 4 years in, I began to have breakthrough bleeding again which was the reason why I began birth control in the first place. So I went to a new doctor and she gave me natazia. Did not desire sex, was very dry, my hair began falling out. Breakthrough bleeding again in month 2. Switched to estrostep fe, did not desire sex, was very dry, my hair fell out in heaps in week two,  I broke out in tiny pimples everywhere, I freaked out and switched back to Yasmin. The damage is done to my hair, but I have a sex drive and I get wet again. (!) I don't need lube anymore. And the tiny pimples are almost 100% gone within 3 days. Never again will I switch. \", \"I started taking the pill at 11 years ago to help with dysmenhorrea (really painful periods) and after trying a few different pills to find one that worked for me I started using Yasmin.  I used Yasmin for many years and it worked very well for me.  Recently my insurance company decided that they would cover Zarah but not the Yasmin so my pharmacy switched me and told me that they were the same pill. When you look at the monograph included with the pills the only noticeable difference is with the non-medicinal ingredients so I agreed to the switch.  I wish I hadn't.  When I first started Zarah I was nauseated on and off for about a month.  Then I noticed that I was getting quite bloated.   My weight has gone up 2 or 3 pounds which doesn't bother me but what does bother me is that I now have a really really bloated abdomen.  I also seem to have some vaginal dryness I didn't have before and my breasts are noticeably larger and often tender.  While my periods are not as painful as they once were, my biggest complaint is that this pill doesn't seem designed for continuous use.  I was instructed by my MD to take 3 packs continuously then have a period then 3 packs and so on to cut down on the number of painful periods.  Unlike when I was on Yasmin, I have painful breakthrough when each period should be (at the end of each pack) as though the dose tapers towards the end of the pack. This defeats the purpose for me taking it and actually makes me question its effectiveness as birth control (which is the secondary reason for me taking it). I've also found I get down and depressed feeling much more easily on this pill than ever before. I've given it a 6 month trial already at this point and when my last 2 packs are done I'll try to switch off of it. I was really satisfied with the Yasmin and will find a way to pay for it instead of the insured Zarah.  \", \"I love this birth control however, I never got a period with this birth control. My face was clear. I took this all throughout high school. I ended up switching only because I have sex a lot and me and my bf agreed I should switch because I wasn't getting a period and it's not normal for a woman to not get a period. \", \"This birth control is great. I have never had a problem with it. Clear skin and maintained my same weight. Also, I'm not pregnant.\", \"I used Zarah to regulate my period and I was only on it for about a year. Once I stopped using it, I started getting major anxiety/panic attacks and it's been 2 months and I still get them. Research your birth control before you decide to use it.\", 'The packaging is a big chunchy plastic that is horrible and to make such a thing it uses a lot of unnecessary resources where as the Yaz packing is so nice and simple, good for carrying in purse. \\nI saved my Yaz pack covers and now I have to pull the zarah package apart and cut off the top of the pill pack so it will fit in the Yaz packaging. I hate this pill because of all this. Going to call my Dr. to get something else. ', 'I began taking this drug for acne about two months ago and have had nothing but a good experience. Unlike some people, I did not experience an initial breakout, in fact my skin began clearing up almost immediately. Not only has this pill helped me improve my self esteem, but it has also helped regulate my periods. Nothing but good experiences with Zarah']",

    "medical_condition_description":"Acne Other names: Acne Vulgaris; Blackheads; Breakouts; Cystic acne; Pimples; Whiteheads; Zits Acne is a skin condition caused by dead skin cells sticking together and clogging up pores. Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from acne worse than others. Bad acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skin’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your acne. It is a myth that you have to let acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin. See a dermatologist if you feel shy or products don't work.",

I got Monodox and only had to pay $10!  I only have to pay $10 for the next 12 months too!  My pills are now tiny and I have no side effects!  My skin has gotten better by the days.  I am so glad that I can take a face medication and not go BROKE!!!  Monodox is the way!!!!', 'Wonderful product! I have been taking two pills a day (75 mg each). It has changed my skin completely. This product cleared up my skin almost instantly and continued to work as it has stopped my skin from having more frequent breakouts and if I do have a breakout, it is small and goes away fairly quickly. It has been a struggle to find a product that actually works and I can personally say, I SWEAR BY THIS PRODUCT! My skin has never been better; it also has appeared to be more \"glowy\" and supple. I went from being very self conscious about my skin, and never liking the look of make up on due to the very annoying bumps under my skin - to feeling more confident and receiving countless compliments! ', 'it caused some dissness but it does not hurt my stomach', 'Has anyone tried Monodox 100mg for Acne-Hormonal- I am 15 days in and I am breaking out BAD- its worse than ever and I am freaking out. My doc says to stick it out 15 days is too early and I need to give it 4-6 weeks...I am also on Ziana gel but I am feeling helpless... Any suggestions on what to expect???????? I take it every night..  I am red and have inflamed cysts. They injected them with cortisone to reduce swelling.....', 'I totally love Monodox! My dermatologist put me on it a month before my wedding just to help with any breakouts that could have occurred. It really cleared up my skin and I was picture perfect on my wedding day!', 'Definate nausea if taken in the morning without food.  Helped with cystic and hormonal acne, but still have some less prominate issues.  ', \"My dermatologist prescribed me minocycline because I developed a large cystic pimple on my cheek. I found upon taking the medication the cyst went away and healed nicely, but my rosacea has significantly reduced to being practically undetectable. I'm going to call my doctor tomorrow to see if I should anticipate my rosacea flaring back up once I finish the prescription. I have heard though from my dermatologist and an other doctor that minocycline should not be consumed before lying down because it can burn the esophagus, and most people experience nausea when consuming it without food. I was also told to stay out of the sun because it increases your chance of burning and even developing a rash. Overall, I'm very happy with this medication!\", 'very helpful. decreseased redness in my face.', \"My doctor suggested this medication for me for my acne, and it really works! My face became very smooth and clear. I'd recommend it to all.\", 'To the mom who had a bad experience with your very sick 16 year old. My daughter was also very sick at 14. Two months of hospitals and dozens of doctors could not diagnose her. She had come home from summer camp with what appeard to be strep throat. Over the next two months she lost too much weight, her symptoms put her in the hospital unable to eat, drink, walk or even sit up. She was on a cocktail of many antibiotics. Her face became paralized. I would come home from the hospital each night and stay up all night looking for an answer. I came in contact with a woman in England that had a similiar experience, she told me to have the doctors look for \"microplasma enphefilites\" not sure on the spelling. And she told me about Doxycycline. She did test positive for it and she started this antibiotic. (we had tried many others first) within 3 days she was standing up and walking. She was able to return to school within two weeks.   So yes you should do your homework on a drug before you take it, but what you can not know a head of time is whether your body will react positive or negative to a drug until you try it. That is why we have so many antibiotics to begin with.  In the case of my daughter, Doxcycline saved her life.

This drug is the treatment of choice for Lyme disease, but it should NEVER be given to minors under the age of 18 or to anyone unable to effectively communicate what symptoms might be occurring.  \\n\\nAlso, it caused the spirochetes to morph into cysts and \"hide out\" until the doxy was out of the bloodstream, so it is only a \"bandaid\" on the infection, at best.

    "Reviews":"[\"People reading these reviews should keep in mind that most people go on the internet to complain, and usually not to say how well something works for them.  I have been using tri-sprintec for a month and really like it.  My skin has cleared up and the only side effect I've experienced is breast tenderness that is starting to go away now.\\n\\nPlease understand that birth control pills do not cause you to gain weight.  That is a myth.  If you gain weight on the pill, it is because you are eating too much, not exercising enough, or both.\", \"It does what it is supposed to do.  That is to prevent pregnancy.  Everyone is going to gain weight or get moody.  You are women!  If you take it as directed, you'll be fine.  I've seen too many over dramatic reviews.  Sure there are side effects, but they are not usually extreme.  They beat having a baby if you aren't ready or don't plan on having one.\", \"I know everyone is different, but I haven't had a single problem with this birth control pill. It is my first, and probably only birth control pill I will take. No side effects at all. I was nervous at first reading all the bad reviews, but it is cheap, and it works. Don't be discouraged from trying this just because a few people had a bad experience. See for yourself, and if you don't like it, switch it. Easy enough. I'm a 19 year old college student who can't afford the brand name, so I'm glad there is something out there for me.\", \"I read large numbers of reviews for birth control before I began taking it. To be honest, I was frightened by all the negative reviews for Tri-Sprintec. Then I remembered something I learned in my business degree: the very dissatisfied are the loudest. I vowed at that point no matter what my experience was, I would write a review. \\n\\nI began taking Tri-Sprintec in January 4 months before my wedding. I chose not to tell my fiance when I started so that if he noticed hormonal mood swings, I would know that this was not the right pill for me. I had no emotional problems. I'd struggled with acne all though high school and college. Tri-Sprintec continues to clear my skin. I have had no weight gain or issues that others have reported. My cramps which used to be very severe and almost gone and can be marginalized with OTC pain killers.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that the pharmacy keeps changing the pills that I'm on. First it was Tri-Nessa, Then Tri-Preventum, Then Tri-Sprintec. It's hard to keep track of what prescription I am taking.\\n\\nLast, be aware. One of those three was changed due to recall. The sheet of pills had been placed in upside down. I now pay attention to make sure that color the inactive pills are supposed to be is the color that they are so I don't take the wrong week.\\n\\nOverall, I'm very satisfied, and I'm not pregnant after 6 months of marriage, which was my main reason for choosing birth control. \", \"Everyone needs to chill. Please don't say you don't recommend this pill because every female will react differently to it. Just because you have had a bad experience doesn't mean the rest of the world will, like myself who has never had a problem with this pill.\", \"I love how everyone complains about weight gain while taking birth control pills. Are you sure its the pills and not the big macs?\\nI've lost weight since taking the pill, no mood swings, and regular periods.\\n\", 'I switched to it from another BC and loved it since. Have no bloating, no acne, no mood swings or any crazy cravings girls here talked about. I actually lost weight. Breasts do get bigger by 2nd or 3rd pill of last week which my BF loves. But other then that no problems just peace of mind. I take it before going to bed so pretty easy to remember.  ', \"Love Love Love this birth control.  I have been using it for a year now.  My skin has looked better in the past year than ever before.  My periods are normal, no cramping.  No emotional side effects at all, no unexplainable crying.  My sex drive is up to par. No weight gain at all in a year, I've either lost or stayed the same.  No babies, the birth control does what it is supposed to do and I would reccomend it to anyone!\", \"Hands down the best birth control I've taken. Before taking it, I had horrible periods that would usually last 10 days and were unpredictable. I had also suffered from acne for the 6 years leading up to starting Tri-Sprintec. I can't even tell you how much money I wasted on acne treatments, including Pro-Active and Clinique. Within two months of being on this pill, my acne was completely gone. Before this, the smallest amount of make-up would make my face breakout worse. While on it, I did not have one breakout. If I wore make-up I never washed it off because I didn't have to worry, but I didn't even need the make-up because my skin was great. My periods were about three to four days while I was on this pill. Life was great. I regret letting my new doctor switch my prescription! I did not gain weight. My only complaint is that I was a little more emotional around the time of my period, but as a woman, I can accept that. \", \"I am on my third week of my first pack.  I was extremely scared to try BC but after my six months of horror with the Depo shot... it's so amazing! I came to college at 130lb and was 167lb after five months on the Depo and spotted EVERY single day.  With this pill, the bleeding stopped within 3 days of use, and I have been so much happier.  I've actually lost weight and experienced my appetite decreasing.  I have had zero mood swings, and I feel really happy.  I really recommend this.  \", 'While I had no problems using Tri-Sprintec (missed it once in 7 months, set a timer every day so I took it between 9:20pm-9:30 every night), I began to experience side effects afters my 5th month using it.  Hair loss, high blood pressure, hot flashes, mood swings, lots of crying.  I was put on blood pressure meds by my doctor after having an anxiety attack one night.  During the anxiety attack I experienced over an hour of uncontrollable shaking (whole body), racing heart, trouble sleeping, needing to go to the bathroom every 20 minutes and general \"freaking out.\"\\n\\nWe thought the blood pressure meds were helping, but after being on them for two weeks I experienced another anxiety attack, and this one was worse: all the aforementioned symptoms, in addition to 5 HOURS of shaking, insomnia, tightness of the chest, and feeling like I couldn\\'t get enough oxygen (even w/breathing exercises).  I went online (thinking I was dying) and realized that this was actually an anxiety attack, and could possibly be brought on by the pill.  Since both attacks happened 1-2 hours after taking the pill... yeah.  My doctor took me off Tri-Sprintec the next day, and I\\'ve been feeling SO much better, and it\\'s been less than a week.  Just goes to show that symptoms may not present themselves for months.  If you feel like you\\'re going crazy, it COULD be your pill!  I\\'ve experienced a lot of stress in the past 6 months as well, which may have led to increases attacks (although I\\'ve never had anything like this before the pill).  I\\'m still trying to figure out what to do now, however, as my husband and I won\\'t be ready to start a family for a few years.  I guess we\\'ll figure it out as we go, and I will be talking to my doctor throughout the process.', 'I have been using Tri-Sprintec for a little over a year and have very little problems. I found that setting an alarm specifically for this medicine can help you take it at the same time, impeding human error. It can be frustrating, however, because some side effects of this drug are also early signs of pregnancy. Preventing human error is one way of giving you confidence with certain side effects.', \"It never occurred to me that all of my problems root from a single pill.  Because of problems in my marriage, I began researching a single symptom ... no sex drive.  Results were stress, medications, and possibly HSDD.  I didn't want to go worst case scenario.  I hate limited space in comments, ugh.  I'm not stressed except for the fact that I dont want sex & its driving a wedge between me & my husband.  So i started researching the side effects of the only medication I'm on ...this stupid pill.  The only good thing about this pill is that i'm still alive & i didnt get pregnant.  My side effects are:  nausea, occasional severe headaches that leave me bed ridden-but are not migraines, bloating, dizziness, vaginal discomfort due to dryness & irritation, acne & blotchy skin-i've always had great skin, spotting & missed or heavy periods, cant wear contacts, water retention, weight gain, shortness of breath, confusion, swelling/warmth in calf muscles, tingling/weakness/numbness in arms & hands, lack of coordination, vision changes, a lump in my breast-unexplained by dr's & tests, mental/mood changes-depression-i was misdiagnosed with being bipolar and schizophrenic, sleeplessness, tiredness-no urge to move at all, hot all the time, no sex drive, irritable, hungry but no appetite satisfaction, anti-social behavior, etc.  I've come up with so many side effects I've quit looking for them.  Its too many. I'm not even going to finish my pill pack.  I'm not even taking a pill tonight.  when my sex drive comes back my husband can wear a condom.  Although he said he would get snipped so i wouldnt worry.  these side effects have created so many problems in my life, if i wouldve been able to think clearly i may have been able to figure it out, but that was one of the side effects. i will quit ranting now. thank you.\", \"While I agree with many of the other commenters that everyone's body is different and everyone's reaction to this pill will be different, I still feel compelled to share to maybe help put others at ease who might feel that this drug is being strange.  I have been on this pill since March.  At preventing pregnancy, at regulating my cycle and at lightening my period (on the last one I was on I was bleeding for like two and half weeks out my cycle), this pill has worked for me and been spot on.  However, the side effects are troubling.  Fortunately, I have had no issues with sex drive or crazy mood swings, but I did have other issues.  At the beginning, acne was horrible.  Now, 7 months later, clear as crystal.  I have also gained about 15 pounds.  Not cute.  I am also constantly bloated and gassy.  Even more not cute.  My boobs are bigger (bonus), but I feel sort of large all over so that sort of doesn't make it as enjoyable.  My period also comes like clockwork, but my periods are getting lighter and lighter each month.  My last period lasted for two days (TWO!!!) and it was super easy.  I hope this helps some people are having similar symptoms and want to feel less alone.\", \"I must say, I was reluctant and somewhat scared to start Tri-Sprintec after all the horror stories I read. I'm almost on my 4th week now, and I'm pleasantly suprised! Into the 3rd week my skin became almost flawless. I'm not pregnant. I haven't gained any weight, nothing beyond gaining and losing 3 lbs which is a normal fluctuation for me. I'll sometimes take it in conjunction with 5-HTP (a natural and very effective supplement you can get at any wal-mart), with makes me more than sunshine-y happy and controls my appetite. It works for some, doesn't for others. For only 9 bucks a month I'd say it's well worth your investment to find out!!\", \"I have been on Tri-Sprintec for about a year and have had very few problems. I actually feel more chill and less likely to erupt over silly things. I'm a little more likely to cry over sappy chick-flicks, but before I was on this BC crying over a film was extremely unlikely for me. I will occasionally feel nauseated, but it's never severe and never lasts very long. My periods are predictable, short, and light, which makes this BC a godsend as my periods prior were heavy and unbearably painful. I don't have a hard time remembering to take the pill at all; all I did was program an alarm in my phone to go off at the same time every day and since I always have my cell on me (as I'm sure most women do these days) I really don't have an excuse to forget. My acne has always been bad, but with this BC it is much easier to control than it used to be. I haven't gained any weight, at my last check-up my Dr. actually commented on my weight loss since starting the pill. I haven't had any pregnancy scares. My sex-drive is completely satisfactory for me and my boyfriend. And at $9 a month I really can't complain.\", \"i have been on tri-sprintec for 3 years now. i've read a lot of negative posts about this pill, but for me it's been WONDERFUL. i haven't experienced any of the negative side effects everyone is complaining about. no nausea, no moodiness, no bloating...no nothing. it's been great for regulating my period and i no longer experience painful cramping (a wonderful bonus). in addition, i've lost close to 20lbs from it...most of it came off the first year i started taking it and i've stayed at a constant weight since then (no fluctuations up or down). i'm unsure why everyone hates it so much, i guess it's because everyone's body responds differently to prescription drugs. i'm just so lucky ortho tri-sprintec agrees so well with me!\", 'I have been on Tri-Sprintec for 4 months now and have had no issues with it.  I was on Ortho Tri-cyclen Lo before but switched because of the expense. I have no nausea, no headaches, and best of all no pregnancy. On Tri-Sprintec my periods are slightly shorter than they used to be and I have hardly any cramping, whereas before going on the pill I had horrible cramps for the first two days.  I would recommend this birth control pill.', 'I have been on this pill for 4 years.  NO sideaffects. Skin is clearer than ever!  When I was in high school I had horrible periods. With this pill, cramps are better, less bleeding!  ', 'I am a twenty two year old women who had blood clots on my brain and two strokes because of this pill. ', \"Well, I've been on this BC for a few years now, at first, I was a emotional wreck after going on it.  Cried all the time out of nowhere, and I'm not normally like that.  I started to have anxiety, depression, my hair started falling out, I've had unexplainable hives, various rashes, weight gain, uncontrollable appetite, dry skin, and the worst, I WAS SO TIRED ALL THE TIME!  I went to the endocrinologist, I've been blood tested TO DEATH...finally, I just decided to go off this dreaded pill and see what happened....and i've been off for a week, and OMG, I feel so human again.  I'm not going to bed at 9 p.m. due to insufferable tiredness, I feel happy, I feel like I can handle stress again without falling to pieces.  My hair STOPPED falling out and got new hair growth, stomach bloat immediately went down, THIS PILL IS THE WORST i've ever been on, and i've been on several over the course of my life, I had no idea, that a tiny little pill, could completely change your entire personality, mood, the way you feel every minute of every day, but this one, IS HORRIBLE.

I have been on this birth control for 6 months now and I don't have a single complaint.  I originally took it to clear my skin and it has done that.

I am very happy with this pill. I havent had any negative side effects. No break through periods, abnormal discharge or mood changes. You must allow a good 3 months for the pill to be in your system before you can determine the real side effects you will have. It's changing your hormones therefore at first you will feel different. I highly recommend this pill. :) \", 'I have been on this pill for 2 months.

I thought I was late and got scared but my period came on the second day of my sugar pills. It was very very light (little to nothing) and I had no PMS symptoms.\\n\\nI hope it continues to work this way.

No weight gain, no nausea, stomach pains, etc.  I'm a non-smoker.  I try to take my pills at the same time everyday but it doesn't always work out that way.  I mean there have been times where I have had to double up several times because I have forgotten to take them and I am still without child.  I believe in Tri-Sprintec, my husband and I have not used any type of protection in two years and it's still working great for me.  I still have acne breakouts so I can't really speak on the effectiveness it has for that although I've never had a serious issue with acne, just a bump or two here or there.  As far as the pharmacy switching up your pills it really depends on the pharmacy you go to and if they carry Tri-sprintec, so if I switch pharms I make sure they carry Tri-sprintec before I take it to them.

My acne was gone, my periods were regular and I knew exactly when I would get them...the Thursday after starting the placebo pills.  Due to all the bad reviews my provider switched me to tri-printec and at first I hated it.  My appetite grew with this pill and I gained 5 pounds in 1 month!!  I didn’t gain a pound on Yaz for the whole 6 months i was on it.  My acne came out…about 2 pimples a week for the first 2 months and during my periods I felt slight cramps and LOTS of bloating.

I might get 1 pimple a month…my periods continued to stay regular but they last 4 days only and NOW I have no cramps.  The only symptoms I do have now are random fatigue and bloating.  But the bloating is not nearly as bad as it was before.  Over all I recommend it, just allow it to take time.  I prefer Yaz but I can handle these pills now.

BUT my cramps have been worse leading up to the period and I have had problems with large clots which I never had before and have had 2 babies vaginally.  The worse part is weight gain.  I have gained 15 pounds in the time I have been on the pill and have not changed my diet for the worse.  I told my dr. I was concerned about this and he said just try weight watchers.  I am hungry all the time which I never experienced before.  I am also more nervous and anxious about things and that is not me either.  I do not like this pill and if I could stop taking it today, I would.  But it will screw up my period even more.  But I am calling my dr. tomorrow and telling him all the problems others report - same as mine - and I want a different pill or I'll get off birth control all together and take my chances.

The only side effect I've noticed was an increase in vaginal fluids which hopefully will stop in a few months, but if not, it's not a bad exchange for birth control without mood swings! I would definitely recommend this pill. I would also recommend people keep in mind that if you start a pill and aren't pleased with it, you're much more likely to post a negative review online than  you're likely to post a positive review if your pill works perfectly well, so don't be discouraged by the negative reviews.

Also if you forget to take a pill and have to take two in one day, be careful and make sure to eat all day or you may throw up. My period lasts 4-5 days moderate flow and I know the day it comes. Overall I love it, it's worked for me. Not a crazy hormonal b*tch at all. Only while on my period sometimes but that's normal for me. Didn't make my face greasy or dry it out. So I would say you should try it, it's not as bad as some reviews make it out to be.

Sure there were episodes of uncontrollable crying, suicidal thoughts and horrible depression (for no reason)... but I continued taking it, Soon I was overcome with horrible social anxiety and I was only comfortable alone in my house... I became withdrawn from my friends and family. I have been on this pill for 10+ years and I am stopping it. I can\\'t take the ups and downs anymore. As I am typing this I am about to cry, I couldn\\'t give you ONE reason for the overwhelming sadness. Its miserable to feel like I do on this pill.

', 'Trisprintec ruined my life. Trisprintec stole my health from me. After being on a low hormone birth control for 6 years, and being healthy and satisfied with the low hormone BC. I switched to TriSprintec only for the cheaper price. Biggest mistake of my life! After just a month i experienced fatigue, weight gain,complete numbness in my arms and legs at night,and terrible mood swings and panic attacks. After a year i started complaining to my doctor about the fatigue and got blood work done. I ended up with thyrodid disease and a nodule in my thyroid. I was advised to stop taking Trisprintec immedietly becuase my symptoms traced back to it, and now I am stuck with thyroid disease and wish i would have never tried this BC. ', \"I've been on Tri-Sprintec for 10 months now and have experienced no negative side effects.  I've definitly not gotten pregnant, my acne has completly cleared up and I've actually lost 10 pounds without trying. So, it has really worked well beyond my original reason for taking it.  \", \"As far as effectiveness goes, I did't get pregnant while on this pill, nor had any pregnancy scares. Ease of use; it's a tiny pill, I thought it was very easy to swallow. However, if I forgot to take a pill at night, I would take the next morning, and unless I had just ate, I would be sick to my stomach. I was not myself on this pill. I gained 25 lbs in almost 6 months. My hormones were driving me insane. I would be furious, or upset over the smallest, and I mean smallest, things. I switched to the Nexplanon and after a month and half, I've lost almost 10lbs and finally back to my old self.\", \"I started this pill almost a year ago. The first day I took it I woke up very sick in the middle of the night. Had slight nausea for the first couple months. Around month 4 I started having mood swings. They got increasingly worse. I want to cry over the most insignificant things, and have a very short temper. Some days I just wake up mad and stay that way. This is NOT my normal disposition AT ALL! It makes me feel like I'm losing my mind. I have also experienced a big decrease in sex drive. It did make my boobs bigger, which is fine, but I have been unable to lose any weight despite getting exercise and eating healthier than I ever have in my life. It took a while but I seem to be having fewer breakouts. Ever since I started I have had light spotting between the 2nd and 3rd week of pills. It is very affordable, which as a student is great. It has also been effective, however I am asking my doctor for other options because I am fed up with the mood swings. I'm tired of feeling like a crazy person.\", \"I'm really sorry to see continued posts with terrible symptoms on Tri-Sprintec.  My daughter passed away from this pill in 7 weeks.  Have you taken time to report your case to the FDA?  If not, would you be willing?

Thank you and God Bless You!\", \"I have been taking this pill since October 2011.  Let just say it didn't work.  I had such serve headache, always feeling down which I have never felt before, no sex drive at all!  This was the first time I have taken this pill.  My doctor was trying to save me some money bc my normal pill would have cost around $75 a month bc of my insurance.  Well just found out two weeks ago I am 9 weeks pregnant thanks to this pill.  I never ever ever missed a pill in my life.  Always took it the same time every single day.  I wish I could sue the maker of this pills.  I wouldn't advise anyone to take this at ALL!!!\", 'I love this Birth Control. The only time I showed ANY side effect was Nausea the first month of taking this Birth Control.

I always recommend my BC to people. :)', 'I am about 75% through my first pack and have had a rough time. My symptoms are so close to pregnancy that I am finding it weird. It is like being pregnant only my symptoms are actually worse than first trimester symptoms. I am tired and falling asleep halfway through the day, feeling depressed for no reason, not sleeping at night as I feel anxious for no reason, my breasts are tender, I have spells of nausea, food cravings, and food aversions. I am trying to stick it out to see if the side effects go away, but my husband already is begging me to switch! I feel like Mrs. Hyde!', \"I started off taking Ortho Tri Cyclen, but soon switched to this generic alternative because the price was much more affordable.\\nI've been on it for almost a year now and it has given me no serious side effects, just some moodiness/extra emotional sensitivity during the first month.  It's doing its job by preventing pregnancy, and it also shortened my periods by a couple of days and made them FAR less painful.\\nAs far as physical changes, I don't think it had an effect on my breasts at all and there has never been any weight gain.  If anything, I think I actually LOST a few pounds, even though I was already tiny at 105 lbs.  My skin was always clear, so I can't tell if there was any change. I would also say that it slowed my sex drive slightly. Nothing too devastating though.\\nI'd recommend this pill to anyone who goes through very painful or long periods and is seeking relief.\", \"Horrible pill. I was on a different birth control pill before and never once experienced these side effects.

I have been in a long depressive state since taking these pills...lost interest in lots of things, headaches (which I never got before), extreme fatigue, and I felt like I couldn't think straight.

I have gained weight over the past few months, which hasn't help my emotional state. I have cut back on food and execrise more to try to get the weight off!! I have one more week of this taking this awful pill and I will be coming off this birth control. I honestly feel like I am going to lose it somedays. I read the reviews before taking and I thought no it will not happen to me, I will be fine. Well the reviews were correct!! Please do not take this pill!!! \", \"So I was extremely excited to start this birth control. I had been on a few different ones. I switched to this one because my insurance changed and this was the easiest option. I got implanon taken out. I loved implanon and had it in for 3 years. I switched to tri-sprintec. \\nThe first week went pretty well. I started it on the sunday after my period like it said to. The first few days I was REALLY HUNGARY. But I didn't gain any weight because I would just snack on healthy food. I don't gain weight easily anyways. 10 pounds would probably do me good. I was nervous every time I started a new week of the pills because of all of the reviews. I never was nauseous though like most people. I did use condoms as a back up birth control during the first few weeks starting it to let my body adjust. Everything seemed to be going well. When I started my dark blue pills which are the last ones right before the white ones, my breast started getting more tender than usual. I just figured it was since my body was about to have a period the next week and the hormones were causing it. Well I started the white pill sunday and was hoping to get my period. Monday, another white pill, still no period. I didn't panic because I read that sometimes while on the pill your period is only 2-3 days long. Well  Tuesday I decided to take a pregnancy test just to put my mind at ease. Honestly I did NOT think i was pregnant because I have 2 kids and I know what it feels like to be pregnant. Well no doubt, I am pregnant. 4 weeks.... REALLY. I don't mind having another kid, but I was just trying to wait a little longer. The only way not to get pregnant seems to have no sex. We used the pill and condoms. Everything worked like it was supposed to, except for the birth control I guess. I am really disappointed since this was such a cheap option. \", 'im on my second week of taking this birth control. already my acne has gone away! but ive had a few side effects like head aches ive had a head ache every day i have taken it so far!also i do have depression and i feel it getting worse with this pill but i do think its just my body getting use to it and it will get better! ... i hope ', \"I've been on tri-sprintec for almost 4 years now and I've had 0 side effects since the very beginning.

You must believe that all bodies and systems are absolutely different, and how people tolerate medications can be like night and day.  For me, this pill is perfect!!

I eat well, exercise, and try to control my stress levels daily.  I am over 35 and take this pill for acne - which has absolutely worked!!

It has made my periods very regular and pretty short. It made my boobs grow which was incredibly painful at first, but doesn't hurt anymore. It also made me have larges amount of discharge. Some days it felt like I wet my pants, no kidding. I talked to my doctor about it and she told me that it was the birth control. The biggest problem I have with this medicine is that it made my sex drive non-existent. Literally. This has put a strain in my relationship with my husband (understandably) and that's the main reason why I am choosing to get off of it.

I have read many posts and it is finally clicking that I think my pill may be the issue. I feel like I have swollen hands, wrists, arms, and ankles.

I have been on this pill around 3 years now, and absolutely hate it. I didn't realize until recently how this pill has made me miserable over the years, and it's been the worst the past 6 months. I gained 10 lbs. immediately after starting this pill. I began having numerous yeast infections and suffering from terrible mood swings, when I am typically a happy, bubbly person. I noticed a major decrease in my sex drive and extreme vaginal dryness. My husband asked me if I wasn't attracted to him anymore, and that is not the case at all. It is so frustrating, and I end up crying over this pill so often! Recently began having chest pains, leg cramps, varicose veins, breast tenderness, and fatigue.

I also had problems with my left leg going numb almost every night and I would get headaches/pains just on the right side of my head. I discussed all this with my doctor who ran blood work to check for blood clots, vitamin D, thyroid, etc...but all tests were normal.

However I now have a well-paying job and no longer qualify to get OTC Lo from PP. I went through my health insurance and found that the pharmacy price was $40/month for the pack. I decided to give Tri-Sprintec a shot since it was only $9. My doctor told me it was almost the same as OTC lo except for the estrogen amounts. I had read mostly bad reviews about Tri-Sprintec but thought I would have a better chance of handling it because of my fitness level (-I am a very active female who goes to the strength trains 4x's a week for 2 hours each, and I play hockey). This week was my first week taking it and I had to stop as of last night (Day 5). The first few days, I was okay and only had slight dizziness at work. On Day 5 and most of today (Day 6) I have experienced rapid heartbeat, extreme migraines, nausea, sharp chest and abdominal pain, extreme moodiness, insomnia, and severe shaking/hunger as if I haven't eaten in days! I called my doctor right away and I'm immediately back on OTC Lo. I was hoping to save money and use Tri-Sprintec, but the $31 I could was not worth what I went through the last couple of days. The weird part was it made me very hungry and shaky and I have never eaten out of control like this. Trying to save $31 by being on Tri-Sprintec, I would've easily spent this savings on food, so it's not really saving! I rarely get sick, and this pill took me down so fast the last 24 hours to the point where I was in bed from being so sick and in pain- I think I'd rather have severe stomach flu! I'm sure this pill works for some people, but it seems based on the reviews it seems the negative outweighs the positive. If cost is a factor, try it and see if it works for you.

I was on Ortho-Tricyclen for years before my first pregnancy in 2005.  Because of my insurance, I have to take the generic version.

I wasn't sure if it was my body adjusting to the artificial hormones that was causing this, or because of this formula of the pill.

I don't keep track of things as well as other reviewers on here, so I don't know exactly when it started, but I know that I was on Tri Sprintec for almost a year and cried every day almost every day. Then, when I switched to Femcon and next Balziva, I became a normal person again. Before I took Tri Sprintec, I had been taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo and didn't realize there was a problem with my moods, but now that I have the perspective from being on Balziva, I think all the tri-phasic pills cause me to feel like I want to cry all the time, whereas the mono-phasic pills such as Balziva and Femcon make me less upset. Actually, with Balziva, I feel completely level-headed and rarely feel like crying. I don't even have PMS now. Tri Sprintec gave me the heaviest periods I've ever had (Super flow tampons for five days, but without BCPs I rarely have a period and when it comes it's like spotting and nothing more), but with Balziva I wear Regular tampons for four days, and sometimes I can go for several hours without a tampon during my period. Anyway, everyone is different, but Tri Sprintec really messed me up emotionally and I don't ever want to switch from Balziva to anything else now.\", \"It was very easy to take, besides remembering to take it everyday. I was on ortho tricyclin low first but switch b/c the first was way too expensive.

I'm also always in a bad mood, the littlest thing can trigger an emotional state & half the time i have no clue why i'm upset or feel like crying. Lately, the migranes have only gotten worse and they seem to be in the same spot (left temple), but now they are spreading down my head towards my neck & around to the other side.

The only thing is, my thighs started to get really itchy the past few days - I thought it was from new sweatpants (lol) but read another comment that she had itchy thighs as well. Still, not a horrible side-effect.

I understand that it is recommended you stay on BC for 3 months for everything to work itself out, but there was no way I was going to wait. \\nFirst month: significant fullness of breasts accompanied by moderate tenderness. Looks good, doesn't feel great. Slight nausea for first week, deep breathing and fresh air helped. Vaginal dryness, slightly moody, nails & hair grow significantly slower. I took a multi vitamin to help combat this as the pill may change the way your body absorbs nutrients. Period- okay, lighter, much less cramping, longer-5 days.\\nMonth 2: Awful! Depressed and ZERO sex drive. Vaginal dryness, first UTI ever. 10lb weight gain due to not wanting to do anything but eat, stare at tv, drink, eat more, sleep =depressed! Ridiculously difficult to become fully aroused. Felt like a zombie and out of my own body. \\nI've been off of this for two months and feel great again.

When I began it in February, my periods had been regular on a 28-30 day basis and lasted about 5 days. I knew that with starting a hormone pill, it may mess with my cycle and that it was necessary to give it time (at least some months) to regulate. Since the first month, I get my period halfway through the 3rd week (last week of active pills) and it does not stop until the end of the placebos, if not longer than that in some occasions. The only exception has been this month, in which I actually got my period on the first day of the 3rd week of pills.

I stopped taking it for a couple of months because I couldn't afford it and I got back on it as soon as I got a new job. The reason I loved these pills so much was because the first time I took them, I lost a lot of weight due to the nausea. I was happy with my body so I could deal with the bad side effects. However, not eating so much caused my hormones to drive me insane and I was always moody and sensitive. I still am actually now that I'm back on the same pill. I am either mean or really sad to the point where I feel depressed. That's really the only downside of the pill. Sometimes it gets so tough that work gets to be really stressful at times in addition to affecting my relationship with my boyfriend (due to me being so mean at times). In order to combat the horrible side effects though, I do a lot to remain positive and keep my spirits up. I make sure to take my daily multivitamin, eat healthy, go for a run a few times a week, and take a 5-htp supplements to help regulate my mood as well.

Also my heart was racing so fast I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I started getting headaches. I took it for 4 days because they say symptoms are suppose to clear with treatment but mine got worse. If I stayed on it I know I would end up in the hospital with extreme dehydration.

I thought it was \"winter blues\" until I realized I have been having horrible mood swings at the end of the 2nd week of pills. So bad that my boyfriend doesn\\'t even want to be around me. At the end of the 3rd week it happens again. I also get more cramps now being on the pill than I did when I wasn\\'t taking anything. The headaches I had during my very 1st week of use continued to happen for about 3 months, each 1st week of the pack, and always around the same time of day (4pm-ish). I\\'m also worried now that I may be pregnant, as my period has been VERY regular since I started this pill and I\\'m late now. I only took this brand because of the low cost and no health insurance, but now I have insurance so I think I will switch to something else once I see a gyno.', \"Beginning week 2 after switching from LoEstrin FE (which did wonders for my skin and overall happiness! insurance wouldnt cover it anymore, so it got too expensive *sigh*). I have felt either very angry or very sad with little happiness in between. I snap easily. I cry even more easily. I'm an emotionally sensitive person to begin with, but this is making it so much worse. I've had strange stomach pains and discharge (as if I'm still in the end days of my period, which ended 5 days ago). Will be asking for a different pill as soon as I can. \", 'i have been taking this for 2 months and have aquired acid reflux, sickness after eating, very gases, naseous frequently. i was excited about the pill at first but the side effects are just too much for me looking for a better alternative.

My breasts are sore and I have 3 pimples, whereas I usually have very clear skin.\\n\\nI've been taking birth control pills for the last 14 years and have never had any significant side effects. I have been on a few different brands, my favorite being Ortho Tri Cyclen.  \\n\\nI am getting off this pill as soon as possible.\", \" I just wish I had listened to all the negative reviews, since I started this medicine 50 days ago I have had severe headaches blooting, painful cramping,extreme mood swings crazy rash and for the last 19 and counting bleeding not the light stuff but heavy. I would tell anyone thinking of taking this pill DON'T! Its not worth the benefits! I stopped 2 days ago and am still trying to get back to my normal self! \", \"I started taking this medication a year ago, and I haven't become pregnant, which I'm sure is the most important thing.  I lost weight when I started taking it, although I've recently put a few pounds back on (not because of this medication, but because I recently had surgery for a torn ACL, so I've been less active).  For what it's worth, I've gathered from the reviews I've read that the majority of women who are dissatisfied with it had switched from lower hormone pills, but if you're just starting on BC or are switching from an equal-hormone pill or Depo, it would probably work for you.  I'll be switching to TriNessa at the end of the month, but not because I'm not satisfied with Tri-Sprintec.  I'm just switching to a different pharmacy that doesn't carry it.\", 'when i got on this drug (switching from ortho tricyclen lo) i experienced mood swings and cystic acne due to too much progestin in my system.  now that i have quit taking it the withdrawls are as bad as getting on it.  i wouldnt reccommend to anyone not already used to the level of hormones contained in this medicine.  it was also difficult for me to lose weight while on this pill.

I haven't yet gotten my period and just started week 4. I really have no complaints other than when I was feeling sick to my stomach which I think was just my body adjusting to the medicine plus other medicines prescribed by my doctor recently and low sex drive is definitely a complaint by both me and my boyfriend. I've had no breakthrough bleeding and no migraines like in other reviews. Everyone is different and all medicines effect people differently but I would recommend this for the fact that I'm not pregnant and that is what this is supposed to prevent. I'll see how my first period goes on these pills and will determine if I really should continue use or switch. Other than all that the pills are very easy to take and remember due to my alarm everyday on my phone. All I can say to people who are looking to take this I'd give it a chance and see how it effects you considering it obviously effects many people differently. I will say it has had its moments of making me more emotional which has caused problems in my relationship but its really not that bad of a birth control.Also I must add on this birth control has not given me any weight gain and has helped with acne. \", \"I started taking Tri Sprintec about 3 months ago. My dermatologist recommended it for acne. With most skin products, the first few weeks caused me to break out but now I have a great complexion. I only get bad pimples a few days before my period, which is normal. Also, my periods are shorter and lighter (and who doesn't love that?) My dermatologist also recommended that I take a vitamin B6 and B12 to help keep me from being moody. It's been working quite well. \", 'I have been using this medication for 7 years and have been satisfied for the most part.

No side effects. I took it for birth control, acne, and abnormal periods. I never got pregnant, and my periods did become a little more regular, but they still last different amounts of time each month and start on different dates. It helped a little with the acne in my hairline, but not so much. I still have moderate acne, and it hasn't really changed. I didn't want to gain a cup size, and as promised by my doctor, I didn't. Overall, I'd say it's you get what you pay for.\", \"Been on this pill for 1.5 years and I have had no major issues.  My periods were around 3 days which I of course loved, and it helped with cramps a lot!

I've also experienced tightness in my chest and the most horrible breast pain (worse then when I was actually pregnant).

I also became very depressed, to the point of withdrawing from my friends and family and crying myself to sleep a lot. I have switched off the pill and I feel like my old self is returning.', \"After reading the reviews about this pill I was scared to start it, and now I see what everyone was talking about!!

I've been taking it for 3 months and I have the worst vaginal itching and dryness but my doctor keeps saying I dont have an overgrowth of yeast so it's not an infection. My sex drive isn't completely gone, but being dry has made it unpleasant, even my periods are unpleasant when using tampons because of no discharge. Not to mention I have pityriasis rosea now (a skin rash of red patches all over my torso) which appeared about one month into me taking tri sprintec. I seriously thought that I was having major unexplained vaginal problems and this rash issue until I started doing some research and reviewing online of Tri Sprintec and saw that I'm not the only one with these issues and it has calmed me down a lot!

Fatigue- I couldn't stay up late, I got too tired.  \\n\\nParting thoughts:  This birth control may affect everyone differently.  The symptoms may also improve after a few months once your body gets used to the changes in hormone level.  I don't know that for sure though because I stopped taking it.  I didn't like feeling pregnant all the time.  BUT, at least that part of it was effective.  I started having intercourse after 6 days of use and did not take the pill at the same time every day, always at different times.

All the testa have come up with nothing. Then, I started thinking that it might be the birth control. I've been off of it for a week and a half, and things are starting to change. The heartburn isn't as bad (still there on occasion though- hoping this gets better with more time), the headaches and nausea have stopped, my sex drive is increasing again, and hopefully the hairloss will ease up as well.

My skin produces far less oil than without the pill. It has also done wonders for my menstrual cramps, period heaviness, and even my nails, hair, and body shape. It's a miracle pill! I knocked a star off its effectiveness rating, however, only because I don't know how effective it is as stand-alone birth control. My only negative side effect was mild nausea for the first 2 months. I find Tri-Sprintec to be somewhat more effective than Tri-Nessa at treating acne. This is a fantastic brand- cheap, effective, and low-risk for otherwise healthy patients!

The HEADACHES made me vomit, I would stay in my room for hours. My sex drive is shot, it's so frustrating, I feel like an impotent male. My anxiety triggers were right under the surface, I would watch fights from the backseat of my mind, little to no control over what I was saying.

I am not pregnant, so it does its job, but the side effects are somewhat hard to take. I feel more anxious than I ever did, and I can cry at everything, where before I didn't cry at anything. It makes me very emotional. The sex drive is not as high as it was before this birth control, and getting aroused takes a lot longer, so often we have to use lubrication... I'm 22 and healthy, so the only reason this could happen is from the hormonal imbalance. \\nOverall the pill does its job, but there are many side effects.

After an emergency surgery I was examined and told I had PCOS and should start taking a BC as a means of controlling it. My OBGYN recommended this right away as the same properties in it that control acne can also be particularly helpful in controlling cysts. She advised me to give it a few months to settle into my system and I'm glad she did. The first month was a bit concerning as I got my period at the beginning of the 3rd week when it should have been during the 4th. My period lasted for the 2 full remaining weeks of the month and was heavier than normal and with mild cramps, which was very unusual for me. That being said, the second month went smoothly and then the third, and so on. My period is now back to normal and perfectly on schedule, maybe even a day or two shorter than before. I haven't had any noticeable issues with cysts (though to be fair, I never knew I had them before my torsion either). As for the acne benefits, I've always had nice skin with very few breakouts, but I do seem to notice them even less since starting this. My advice... give it a few months if your first month is a bit concerning. Your body may just need time to adjust.\", \"I've been on this birth control for about a year and a half now and I absolutely love it.

I usually have moderately painful cramping during my period and some clotting, but so far I have seen neither.  I have been a little fatigued lately but that can be explained by a very physical job and nicotine withdrawal (quit smoking almost two weeks before starting this pill so I could adopt a healthier lifestyle and not worry as much about developing blood clots.) It seems as though I have been getting more solid sleep and my skin seems to be improving some (only 1-2 blemishes this period compared to about 6-7 blemishes during usual periods). I only have two concerns--my period seems to be slightly heavier than usual so I hope it doesn't last longer or cause breakthrough bleeding or spotting.  The other concern is that it may have caused me to get dizzy and black out a second at work yesterday.

I gain ~ 5 lbs for 3 weeks of the month then lose it and get back to my normal weight for one week - my PMS and period weeks last 3 weeks so I'm bloated and heavier that whole time.  It's awful.  I just eat and eat and I don't want to eat but I can't stop.  I've been eating healthier and exercising for the past 10 months, and this bc has made all my progress go the opposite direction.  Also, I will get my EXTREMELY HEAVY period on Tuesday or Wednesday, (literally have to wear both a tampon and a pad)and then it will last until Friday night - it will be gone all day Saturday and then return Sunday night - light, but enough that I still have to wear a pantiliner - and that lasts 2-4 more days.  It's very frustrating to not know why it's coming back and be gaining all this weight even though I'm trying to stay healthy.  I am not a fan of this, although it has been easy & effective at preventing pregnancy, altho I use condoms as well for double protection.

Of course I told him that I was, and he told me to stop taking them immediately. I asked what the issue was, he explained that the estrogen in the pills caused the tumors and that 35% of women on the pill would get these tumors. I then asked why are they still on the market then, his answer was because the benefits out weigh the risks.

I am telling everyone I know that is on the pill to have a simple blood test done to check their liver.

Instead of the usual one day before and first three days of period cramps, I started cramping the whole week before and about five days during. Also, it really messes with my emotions. I frequently cry for no reason. If I'm not crying, I am completely numb (emotionally). I am nauseous a lot of the time, and can only manage to down certain things. Overall, I am very unhappy with this medication. Basically, my cramps are worse, I am depressed all the time, and I am nauseated most of the time.

I also had abdominal pain that really wasn't that bad. I am very concerned if me vomiting is a normal side effect. Hopefully it is.

I had Tri-Nessa for 2 months and just got switched over to Tri-Sprintec as a new generic substitute.  I'll start taking it tomorrow, but after reading these reviews I'm now very hesitant.  The side effects sound awful.  I had no problems with OTC.  I've had some intestinal issues lately which coincide with when I started taking the TN, but the doc says it probably wasn't caused by the pills (???).  So now that I have TS I'm hoping I'm one of the seemingly few that have a positive experience with it.  But I'm definitely woried now.\", \"I've been on this for three months.

Once that stopped, I went off it. My dermatologist prescribed it for me to control my acne. I really didn't notice it working that much for my acne, but it did somewhat. Once on the pill for about 3 mos, I develpoed ovarian cysts that would flare up horribly bad and disappear when I got my period. This would only happen on my left side. I never noticed this happening when I wasn't on the pill. After taking this pill for 2 years, I went off to try and get pregnant, which never happened. So, I went back on it and once again the cysts came back. I talked to my OB/GYN and he called in a RX of Alesse for me to try.

Yeah! \", 'This medication worked great at treating my intolerably painful periods.\\n\\nHowever, during the first six months I took this medication, it severely altered my mood and personality and I had a major emotional breakdown, I think predominantly as a result of this medication.  \\n\\nAdditionally, during the first six months, it made my skin remarkably dry and flaky all over my body, and no amount of moisturizer could keep me from peeling all over.

I went to several doctors and nobody could give me an answer to what it was, until I had a biopsy done (among other tests) and it turned out to be a hypersensitivity reaction to this birth control!

I was never one to have cramps before, or be moody. I have gained about 12  pounds since I started this pill. My cycle is heavier than it was with my last BC and I am very emotional with this pill. I also have had bad abdominal pains not even during my cycle. I would never recommend this pill due to all the problems I have had with it. The pill has had a small effect on my sexual drive.

My first day starting this pill I actually lost 4 pounds! Then gained it all back a week later, boo. But I also slept the WHOLE day, I was so exhausted. I was sleepy and light headed for the 1st week but that wore off. I do still get nausea and hot flashes every night, at times waking with dry heaves. But that does seem to be improving with time. I started this pill because my periods are so heavy theyre causing anemia. It has not made it any worse or better, but it caused a lot of menstrual clotting, which was weird. Breasts are slightly larger, which to me is a plus. Overall the nausea is a LOT better than it was on ortho tri cyclen. Remember it  takes 3 months for any type of BC to stabilize inyour body. This is only my first pack so I will update more later.', \"I have only been on tri sprintec for two months and so far all the symptoms I've experience where nausea, increase in appitite right after i take it, and little mood swings. These symptoms don't happen every day so that's good. I dont know if it will protect against pregnancy because I have not had sex yet while takeing these.

I was scared about taking it at first, reading all these bad reviews, but it really all depends on you and not anyone else. I am sexually active pretty much everyday, and after 2 weeks of taking this my fiancé partially ejaculated in me, but I didn\\'t get pregnant. I would say to wait a whole month instead of a week before you start having unsafe sex just to be safe.

OMG!!!!!!', 'Low sex drive!!!!', 'Began this birth control in June and it caused a 10 lb. weight gain and complete loss of sex drive.

I guess I've been lucky bc other than a little weight gain (which may or may not have been the BCs fault), I feel perfectly normal. I just don't like the packaging. I'm abstinent so I can't tell you if it works well in that regard, but I haven't had any more problems with cysts.\", 'I have been on this pill for about 3 months and every time I take it, my stomach hurts and that is with food.

I am going to try something else, I got on this because it was cheaper.', \"I was on this BC for 7 years and out of no were I started gaining weight and my sex drive went out the window.

I immediately started having terrible side effects more so then any other pill I have taken. My breast became extremely tender, horrible anxiety attacks, gained 7lbs in 8 days, horrible breakouts and I have very clear skin. Cramps have been all month long and the second month of taking this I have keep bleeding through the entire month after my actual cycle. Got on it because it was cheap but it's so not worth It in my opinion.  \", 'the only problem i have had taken the meds is my lower stomach always hurt right befor or during a period i was told i needed to not take it anymore now i am scared im pregant because my boyfriend *to much to share on line*', \"Overall I'm pleased with this birth control.  I was on Ortho Tri cyclen lo but decided to make a switch to this.  For me its only 5 dollars a month so how can I complain?  I've been on this medication for quite a few months now and I haven't noticed any horrible side effects like many other women on here are talking about.  I may get a little more emotional than usual sometimes but it seems pretty normal to me.  As far as my acne goes, I'm not really sure if this pill is doing its job.  And as far as skipping periods and break through bleeding goes, this pill fails.  If you mess up ever so slightly you will have break through bleeding for a full month until your next period.  But I do feel very protected on this pill.  And now that I've changed my starting day I don't mind my periods as much.  I guess I can't expect magical things to come out of this pill.  It's prevented pregnancy effectively and I'm happy enough with that.  I may change my pill the next time I go to the gyno but its definitely going to take a lot of thought.\", 'I had multiple side effects for several months and this included serious weight gain and illness.  It effected my ability to work due to illness so often.', \"I have been taking this medicine for seven months.

    "medical_condition_description":"Acne Other names: Acne Vulgaris; Blackheads; Breakouts; Cystic acne; Pimples; Whiteheads; Zits Acne is a skin condition caused by dead skin cells sticking together and clogging up pores. Bacteria can play a role, too. A big trigger for the onset of acne is puberty. Better nutrition and living standards have seen the age of puberty, especially in girls, decrease significantly over the past 40 years. It is now not uncommon for girls as young as 7 to develop acne. Acne is also affecting more adults later in life and doctors are not sure why. A growing number of women have acne in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond. What Causes Acne? Our body constantly makes and sheds skin. Normally, dead skin cells rise to the surface of the pore and just flake off our body. At puberty, hormones trigger the production of sebum - an oily substance that helps moisturize our skin. Sebum sticks dead skin cells together, increasing their chances of becoming trapped inside a pore. Clogged pores become blackheads, whiteheads or pimples. If bacteria are also present, redness and swelling can occur resulting in the progression of the pimple into a cyst or nodule. Who is More at Risk of Acne? Unfortunately, some people suffer from acne worse than others. Bad acne tends to run in families - your mother, father, aunt or uncle probably had severe breakouts when they were a teenager. Some people also have naturally higher hormone levels and make more sebum, so their skin pores are always clogging up. If you live in an area that gets very humid or have a job which exposes you to moist heat (such as in a food kitchen) or grease or tar (a mechanic or road worker) then you are more likely to get acne. Chin straps, headbands, and even hair products applied too close to the skin can precipitate a break out as several different medicines - most notably prednisone, phenytoin, and certain hormonal contraceptives that are high in androgens (for example, Microgestin 1.5/30 and the Depo-Provera shot). What are the Symptoms of Acne? Acne may appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back or shoulders. The symptoms and severity of acne vary from person to person but may include: Whiteheads Blackheads Papules (small, red, tender bumps) Pimples (papules with pus at their tips) Nodules (large solid painful lumps beneath the skin surface Cystic lesions (painful pus-filled lumps beneath the skin’s surface). How is Acne Diagnosed? If your acne makes you shy or embarrassed, if you have a lot of acne, cysts or nodules on your face or back, or if over the counter products do not seem to work, see your doctor or a dermatologist as soon as you can. They can prescribe stronger topical or oral treatments that are much more effective than products you can buy at a drug store. Your doctor will look at your skin and ask about the history of your acne. It is a myth that you have to let acne run its course. Treatment helps prevent dark spots and permanent scars from forming as the acne clears. How is Acne Treated? The most important thing you can do to reduce the chance of breakouts is to take good care of your skin. This doesn't mean scrubbing it raw several times a day with soap. It means gently cleansing it with a mild soap-free wash twice a day, every day. If you play a lot of sport or work in a greasy or humid environment, cleanse your skin as soon as you finish training or right after work. Be gentle. You aim to cleanse away excess sebum and dead skin cells so they don't clog up your pores - not to irritate your skin even further. The first step to clear skin is clean skin. Look for a cleanser that is soap-free and does not contain any harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates, which can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation. Avoid pore-clogging ingredients as well, such as algae extract, carrageenan, lanolin, myristyl myristate, octyl palmitate, octyl stearate-5, and oleth-3. Anti-acne ingredients work by removing dead skin cells, unclogging pores, or reducing bacteria numbers on the skin. Acne treatments usually contain one of the following ingredients (some of which are only available on prescription): Benzoyl peroxide Salicyclic acid Resorcinol Azelaic acid Dapsone gel Retinoids and retinoid-like creams, gels, and lotions Topical antibiotics Oral antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, Combined oral contraceptives Oral isotretinoin Spironolactone Lasers and photodynamic therapy Chemical peels Steroid injections. If you have severe acne you need to be very proactive with skin cleansing and using acne treatment. Seeing a dermatologist early on for prescription products lessens the chances of being left with permanent scars. How Can I Prevent Acne? Gently wash your face twice a day and after sweating. Shampoo your hair regularly. Do not pick or squeeze your acne; this increases the risk of scars. Keep your hands off your face. Wash your hands before applying make-up. Be careful what you put on your face, and avoid ingredients that promote acne. Stay out of the sun and off tanning beds; excess tanning can damage your skin. See a dermatologist if you feel shy or products don't work.",
